1115,5069,"Thank you. Doctor X, could you go over the diagnosis of erythema nodosum?
Doctor_2: She was diagnosed in two thousand and four after a biopsy was done that confirmed erythema nodosum, but the detail from the Netherlands is not that specific.",Affirmative
1115,5069,"What kind of procedures were done to address it? 
Doctor_2: She had undergone a colonoscopy to address secondary diseases that may have been present because of the erythema nodosum, correct miss?",Neutral
1115,5070,"Were there any findings, Doctor X? 
Doctor_2: The findings were uncertain if the terminal ileum had abnormal biopsies. However, the skin biopsy mentioned some fibrosis, basal proliferation, and inflammatory cells in the subcutis.",Neutral
1115,5070,"I see. Her report states something about a tibia and fibula fracture on her right leg before the erythema nodosum. Are these skin lesions due to the fracture? 
Doctor_2: The skin lesions are not associated with the fracture, correct ma'am?",Neutral
1115,5071,"Thank you. Did anything occur before the skin lesions? 
Doctor_2: She had cosmetic surgery done on her jaw.",Affirmative
1115,5071,"Ma'am, I see you visited our clinic and the Dermatology several times, correct?",Neutral
1115,5072,"Doctor X, did you confirm with any tests? 
Doctor_2: Yes. There was an initial S E D above one hundred and ten and her C P R was increased.",Affirmative
1115,5072,"Great. In the visits after, were there any other problems found? 
Doctor_2: The reports says that no other abnormalities were found. However, I do see something about her first visit.",Affirmative
1115,5072,"Could you explain what it says?
Doctor_2: She has some M T P detected, which could have been signs of erythema nodosum. However, the Dermatology did not agree, and they believed it to be venous stasis.",Neutral
1115,5072,"The venous stasis could have been related to the fracture, right? 
Doctor_2: That is correct.",Affirmative
1115,5072,"Her initial visit reports suspicion of I B D, sarcoid inflammatory arthropathy, and lupus. Why was that? 
Doctor_2: She had a questionable rheumatoid fracture even though her C C P was negative. Her A N A was positive at one to four zero. There was a persistent speckled pattern. However, the rest of the lupus serologies were negative.",Neutral
1115,5072,"What lupus serologies were used? 
Doctor_2: Double stranded D N A, R N P, Smith, R O, and L A were used.",Neutral
1115,5072,"How did her cardiolipin antibodies panel look? 
Doctor_2: They were all negative. We made sure I g M, I g G, and I g A were less than ten.",Neutral
1115,5072,"I see. Was there anything else in the report? 
Doctor_2: She had her beta 2 glycoprotein one or R V V T tested.",Neutral
1115,5072,"That seems important because of the livedo pattern. 
Doctor_2: Exactly. That's why they concluded it was an onset of lupus and not rheumatoid arthritis because the arthritis couldn't be associated with erythema nodosum.",Affirmative
1115,5072,"Why did she undergo a C T scan?
Doctor_2: We feared she had lymphoma. The scan of her chest, abdomen, and pelvis were done to rule out sarcoid.",Neutral
1115,5072,"I see. The results came out normal, right?
Doctor_2: That's correct.",Affirmative
1115,5072,"Did you change some of you habits to help your bowels, ma'am?",Empathetic
1115,5073,"That's good. What was found Doctor X? 
Doctor_2: There was evidence of B twelve deficiency with a high methylmalonic and high homocystine levels along with a low normal B twelve in addition to iron studies consistent with iron deficiency and an initially low M C V.",Affirmative
1115,5073,"That gives the possibility of inflammatory bowel disease, right?
Doctor_2: Correct. That's stated in the report.",Affirmative
1115,5073,"Were there any tests done to confirm this? 
Doctor_2: She underwent a colonoscopy, which showed nothing. Her endoscopy was also normal. Recently, she underwent a second coloscopy, and no evidence of inflammatory bowel disease was seen after viewing it microscopically.",Neutral
1115,5073,"Nothing was seen microscopically? 
Doctor_2: Actually, we determined there were aggregates of eosinophils.",Neutral
1115,5073,That sounds important. That could be due to an allergic reaction or an emergence of Crohn Disease. I will have to discuss with Doctor Y from Gastroenterology to see the significance.,Neutral
1115,5074,"Is that correct, Doctor X?
Doctor_2: That is. I think these details were from somewhere else.",Affirmative
1115,5074,"At least we are aware of it. What medication was provided during her first visit? 
Doctor_2: It looks like she was placed on forty milligrams of prednisone. The strength was reduced over time.",Neutral
1115,5074,"This may be a reason to her acne. Was she taken off this medication?
Doctor_2: Yes, she was. There were too many adverse effects.",Affirmative
1115,5074,"What was she places on after?
Doctor_2: It looks like she started a point six m g colchicine, which she took daily.",Neutral
1115,5074,"How were her inflammatory markers after taking it? 
Doctor_2: Her markers were under control and positive. She also didn't have any evidence of erythema nodosum.",Affirmative
1115,5074,"That is great. How did you like that medication, ma'am?",Affirmative
1115,5075,"I see. Is that stated on the report, Doctor X? 
Doctor_2: It is. I also see that she was reevaluated by Dermatology.",Affirmative
1115,5075,"Did they find anything apparent? 
Doctor_2: No, they didn't. They didn't find any evidence of erythema nodosum.",Neutral
1115,5075,"What was the plan following that? 
Docotr_2: It looks like we proceeded with a D E X A scan and checked her vitamin D levels.",Neutral
1115,5075,"Was there any medication prescribed? 
Doctor_2: We ordered vitamin D and calcium to be bought over the counter so that her bones were protected. However, they use of them was stopped until we figured out the underlying cause of her disease.",Neutral
1115,5075,"I see. Other than the fracture and jaw surgery, was there anything else? 
Doctor_2: It shows she had Varicella and Mononucleosis, correct ma'am?",Neutral
1115,5076,"That's good. Our recent physical exam with you from last August showed changes in your venous stasis and diffuse periarticular ankle edema. Fortunately, we did not find any erythema nodosum, but the livedo patter was still present.",Affirmative
1115,5077,"We did find a heart murmur, so we will conduct an echocardiogram. Doctor X, could you confirm all the details form the workup, please?
Doctor_2: Of course. Her A C E levels were normal. Her sed rate was around 30, which was high. Before that, it was around one ten, which is even higher. Her R V V T was normal. The rheumatoid factor was negative. The urinalysis was also normal. She had a C R P level of two point three, which was high. Her C C P came out negative. Her C B C displayed microcytosis and hypochromia with hematocrit levels of thirty seven point seven. Her hematocrit levels improved to forty point three later on, and she did not have any hypochromia, microcytosis, or anemia present.",Neutral
1115,5077,"Thank you for all that information. Does all this information and history seem to be correct, ma'am?",Affirmative
1115,5078,"No problem. I see you're here today regarding some mild but intense skin rashes. You mentioned that you thought it was erythema nodosum, correct?",Neutral
1115,5079,"I will take note of that. You also mentioned something about a rash before. Did you have a rash that was sensitive to U V light, like sunlight?",Neutral
1115,5080,When did you notice the rashes?,Neutral
1115,5081,I see. Do you think it had to do anything with your acne?,Neutral
1115,5082,"The prednisone and colchicine we mentioned earlier, correct?",Affirmative
