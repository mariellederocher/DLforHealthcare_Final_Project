310,67,270,I'm just checking for lymph nodes. Whenever there is an infection those guys are the first ones to be noticed with swelling.
311,67,270,"Okay, so let's first check your neck area. It looks good. I don't feel any inflamed lymph node. Your armpits look good too and the last place to check is your groin area. It is all good. No sign of infection."
312,68,270,What are some medications you are on?
313,68,271,Do you know their names?
314,68,272,Okay that helps.
315,69,272,I am looking at the list of your medication.
316,69,273,All I can see is Risperdal and Invega.
317,69,274,Are you not taking anything else?
318,69,275,"Yes, you should. We need to know everything."
319,70,276,"Good morning, ma'am."
320,70,277,"Please, tell me about your living situation."
321,70,278,"I see here that you're not able to go up the stairs well, can you tell me more about that?"
322,70,279,Holding the rail makes navigating the stairs easier?
323,70,280,I see. Do you smoke?
324,70,281,What about exercise? Do you workout?
325,71,283,Okay. I did not get the blood report yet. I am waiting for your doctor's office to send it to me. Is it only your potassium that is elevated?
326,72,284,"I am sorry! He does have multiple trauma due to the accident, and he will require aftercare. 
Guest_family: Yeah."
327,73,284,"So, what is your family's living situation at home?
Guest_family: Um, he lives at home with me, and his father."
328,73,284,"May I assume that you are his biological parents? 
Guest_family: Yes, that's correct."
329,73,284,"Great, does he have any siblings? 
Guest_family: No, right now, he's an only child."
330,73,284,"What grade is he in? 
Guest_family: He's in the third grade."
331,73,284,"Great, and is he doing well in school? 
Guest_family: Yes, he's doing quite well."
332,74,284,"Good afternoon, what gender do you identify with?"
333,74,285,Thank you. Do you know of any chronic illnesses?
334,74,286,"Well, high blood pressure, osteoarthritis, diabetes, depression, anything like that ring any bells?"
335,75,287,Do you have any major medical conditions that I should know about?
336,75,288,"It doesn't have to be that serious, but is there anything you take medicine for?"
337,76,289,Can you tell me something about your mom and dad?  Like any diseases they have had?
338,76,290,"How's about siblings, miss? Any health issues?"
339,77,291,Does anyone in your family suffer from any health problems?
340,77,292,Great.
341,78,292,"Tell me, what's going on? 
Guest_family: She is complaining of weakness on the right side of her face."
342,78,293,"Okay, let me look at it."
343,79,293,"My chart here says that you're eighty three years old, is that correct, ma'am?"
344,79,294,Happy belated birthday! How have you been doing since your last visit?
345,79,295,"That's great, you have been treated for polycythemia vera, correct?"
346,79,296,"I also see you're unassisted today, which is also great."
347,80,297,"So, do you have any family history of cancer?"
348,80,298,"Still, that's helpful, thank you. What about heart disease?"
349,81,299,"As far as you know, are there any major health conditions that you know about?"
350,81,300,"Anything like cancer, or arthritis, do those sound familiar?"
351,82,301,Do you have any medical history that we should be aware of?
352,82,302,"Okay, anything else?"
353,82,303,Okay.
354,83,303,Hello. How are you feeling today?
355,83,304,"Oh, good. I see your past medical history is missing. Do you, by chance, know if you've had any health related problems before?"
356,83,305,"Thank you. I just want to verify the information with you. You had asthma, nasal inflammation, and some abnormal growth on you neck, correct?"
357,84,306,"How's the little one doing?
Guest_family: She is doing okay."
358,84,306,"How long was your pregnancy?
Guest_family: Thirty six weeks."
359,84,306,"Was your delivery normal or C section?
Guest_family: It was a C section."
360,84,306,"How much did she weigh? 
Guest_family: She was eight pounds and three ounces."
361,84,306,"Tell me what's the issue?
Guest_family: Yeah, she has a history of seizures. It looks like she is having pain in her tummy and is throwing up."
362,84,306,"What else did you notice?
Guest_family: It looks like she is having some rashes on her skin. There is vomiting for sure. She also feels bloated. She also complains of pain in her tummy. Sometimes she does scratch her mouth. We also noticed some swelling around her lips, eyes and face."
363,84,306,It looks like she's having some food intolerance.
364,85,306,What medications are you taking right now?
365,85,307,Okay is it helping you?
366,85,308,But is it like better than Claritin?
367,85,309,Okay that's good.
368,86,310,Anybody sick in family?
369,86,311,How about any illnesses that run in your family?
370,87,312,Hi again! How has your acne been since you started the spironolactone?
371,87,313,"Have you experienced any increased thirst, mood changes or unusual fatigue?"
372,88,314,"Well, I don't think you need any restraints as you are doing fine. I do want to make sure you have a chair and bed monitor since you have a history of multiple falls. They can help detect fall."
373,88,315,Are you sure?
374,89,316,Do you know when was the last time you got a tetanus shot?
375,89,317,Okay.
376,90,317,Hi there! How are you today?
377,90,318,Welcome in!
378,90,319,Lets start with a little social history. Are you a tobacco or alcohol user?
379,90,320,Are you married? Do you have children?
380,90,321,Do you currently see a gynecologist?
381,90,322,Great.
382,91,322,Tell me about your family medical history.
383,92,323,Welcome in.
384,92,324,Do you smoke?
385,92,325,I agree. Do you drink alcohol?
386,92,326,How much do you drink per day or week?
387,92,327,Okay.
388,93,327,The nurse applied antibiotic ointment and a bandage to your foot. Did she go over how to change the bandage at home?
389,94,328,"Hello. Before we begin, I need you to confirm some information for me."
390,94,329,About your family. Do you know if you have certain medical conditions that run in your family?
391,95,330,How about any breathing issues or asthma?
392,95,331,"Oh okay, and was it severe or mild?"
393,95,332,"Hm, alright.  Anything else?"
394,95,333,Got it.
395,96,333,"How's she doing? 
Guest_family: She's had better days."
396,96,333,"Aw and why's that? 
Guest_family: She's been really congested recently. Snorting a lot more, too. She's onlt eleven and I think it is odd she snores so much. I took her to see the allergist and he said it's not her allergies so we stopped giving her Allegra."
397,96,333,"Does she happen to snore at night? 
Guest_family: No, not really."
398,96,333,"Hm. 
Guest_family: And while we're here, I also wanted you to check out her toe. The right big toe appears a bit red to me. The skin around it has been peeling for the last week and a half."
399,96,333,Lemme take a look. Have you applied anything to the area?
400,97,333,Why are you holding your face?
401,97,334,"Oh, how bad is it?"
402,97,335,I am so sorry.
403,98,335,Have you had similar symptoms before?
404,98,336,Any other complaints you have had in the past?
405,98,337,"Okay, so chronic knee pain."
406,99,338,Can you tell me about any cancers in your family?
407,99,339,Oh I am so sorry.
408,99,340,Any heart conditions?
409,100,341,Can you tell me what problems you have had in the past. Or what medical issues are currently going on?
410,100,342,Yes.
411,100,343,Okay.
412,100,344,Your urine creatinine is normal.
413,101,345,Does anyone else in your family have aneurysm problem?
414,101,346,"Oh, okay."
415,102,346,What is wrong with your back honey?
416,102,347,Okay what exactly are you experiencing?
417,102,348,So you came to the hospital on the first and they did an I and D in E D?
418,102,349,Okay sugars high. Do you know the number? How high?
419,102,350,So today we are evaluating you for surgery?
420,103,351,Hi there! I have the results from your ultrasound. You have kidney stones in the ureter close to the bladder.
421,103,352,This explains the pain you have been having on your left side. Are you still experiencing nausea and vomiting?
422,103,353,I would like to set you up with a consult with a consult with a surgeon.
423,104,354,Any known drug allergies?
424,105,355,"Your daughter had an exposure to the ant bait but we are not sure if she actually ingested any of it. Poison Control confirmed that even if she did ingest the small amount that she was found with, it is likely nontoxic. Do you have any questions? 
Guest_family: No."
425,106,355,"Hello, sir. How are you today?"
426,106,356,That is not good. How long has this been happening?
427,106,357,Is there any other family medical history I should know about? Migraines or cancer?
428,107,358,Do you know anyone in your family whose had cancer?
429,108,359,Okay so your blood report is back and the cardiac enzyme we were looking for are negative.
430,108,360,"Your blood urea nitrogen, also known as B U N, is within normal limits and hydrogen is stable. Creatinine is also within the normal range."
431,109,361,Are you on any medications?
432,110,362,"Hi, how are you doing today?"
433,110,363,"So, you are here for your follow up right? Remind me how often are you coming here?"
434,110,364,"Yeah, it's every four to eight weeks."
435,110,365,"Yeah, I can see it in your record. It says that you are off of all the immunosuppression. So, just let me check. It says here that you do have mild chronic G V H D. It is not that bad that I should be worried about any therapy or anything else. How long ago did you get that transplant?"
436,110,366,"Okay, let me see in my chart. You had some rectal bleeding issues because of which I referred you to the gastroenterologist. A complete endoscopy was performed, which was both on the upper and the lower side. There was no evidence of ulcers or any other abnormality. That's  good news, right?"
437,110,367,"They did find some polyps and they removed it. They turned out to be benign, so nothing to worry about there."
438,110,368,Is there any other issue that I can help you with?
439,110,369,"It looks like you have a mild iron deficiency. I will work on that with you, don't worry."
440,111,369,Are you feeling any pain?
441,111,370,Is there any other medical issue that we should be worried about?
442,112,371,Thank you for coming in to see us at A B C D General Hospital today.
443,112,372,"I understand, before we begin, how old are you?"
444,112,373,"Which race, and gender do you identify with?"
445,112,374,What's seems to be causing you pain today?
446,112,375,Is the pain worsening?
447,112,376,How have you managed this bunion in the past?
448,113,377,Do you have diabetes or blood pressure problems?
449,113,378,Alright.
450,114,378,How are you dealing with your pain now?
451,115,379,"Did you have any medical disorders previously, sir?"
452,115,380,Are you taking any medications for that?
453,115,381,Do you smoke?
454,115,382,How many cigarettes do you take in a day?
455,116,383,Lets talk about your ears. Any continuous ringing or thumping noises you may hear?
456,116,384,Any hearing problems?
457,116,385,Any dizziness or spinning sensation?
458,117,386,"Good morning, ma'am. You're eighty two years old, is that correct?"
459,117,387,"Good, and just one more piece of background information, which hand do you write with?"
460,117,388,"Good, so what seems to be the problem today?"
461,117,389,What kind of treatments have you had?
462,117,390,Can I assume the pain is impacting your daily life?
463,118,391,Have you ever had surgery?
464,118,392,"Well, anything from joint replacements, to appendix removal, or C sections?"
465,119,393,"Can you confirm your age for me, ma'am?"
466,119,394,"Good, so it's been about five months since you last evaluation for type two diabetes and high blood pressure."
467,119,395,"Sure, we can treat all of them. What seems to be the problem today?"
468,119,396,Can you remember an injury to this shoulder?
469,119,397,What aggravates your symptoms?
470,119,398,"Do you have any weakness, numbness, or tingling?"
471,119,399,"Okay, back to diabetes, how has that been progressing?"
472,119,400,Have you been checking your blood sugar two hours after meals?
473,119,401,Do you have any records to prove that?
474,119,402,"That's important, do you have any other issues or concerns today?"
475,119,403,"Okay. I'm looking at your charts, and I see you had a benign breast biopsy done on June eleventh two thousand four. Did you have a repeat done after six months like they asked?"
476,120,404,What is your family medical history?
477,121,405,"Do you mind giving me a run down of his past medical history? I want to make sure it's all in his chart. 
Guest_family: Sure. I'll start with his surgeries. If I remember correctly, he had back surgery, a couple knee surgeries, and coronary artery bypass surgery with angioplasty."
478,121,405,"I see. When did he have these done? 
Guest_family: I'd have to check, but I know he had back surgery in O nine. He has a history of high blood pressure and high cholesterol. He was recently diagnosed with B P H potentially linked to cancer. It's B P H, right? Or is it B H P?"
479,121,405,"If it's his prostate, then B P H is correct. 
Guest_family: Oh, he has high P S A levels, too. I think that's related to the prostate."
480,121,405,"Is he currently experiencing any symptoms? 
Guest_family: He was complaining of pain earlier. He does have a history of fatigue, tiredness, and shortness of breath though. So far, he hasn't complained about the usual."
481,122,405,"How long have you been living with diabetes, sir?"
482,122,406,How long have you been taking insulin for this?
483,122,407,Do you have any major medical conditions that I should know about?
484,122,408,How were you treated for this?
485,123,409,"So, what stomach symptoms are you experiencing?"
486,123,410,When do you feel this?
487,123,411,That's pretty consistent with reflux disease.
488,123,412,"I got your survey results back as well, let's discuss them."
489,123,413,"According to your answers, it looks like you have depression as well."
490,124,413,Any difficulty in swallowing?
491,124,414,"Any nausea, vomiting or blood in your vomit?"
492,124,415,"Okay, any stomach pain?"
493,124,416,Okay.
494,125,416,"Hello, ma'am. How are you feeling today?"

497,127,419,Are you allergic to anything?
498,128,420,Are you a smoker?
499,128,421,Excellent! Have you weighed your self recently?
500,128,422,And how tall are you?
501,128,423,That is definitely a possibility. We do shrink as we go through life. I can have the nurse get your height after we do your exam.
502,129,424,Do you smoke?
503,130,425,"Welcome to the clinic, sir."

591,145,508,We did electromyography study. This was to assess the health of muscles and the nerves in your body. When did you first notice this discomfort?
592,145,509,"Yeah, I can see that you have taken different kinds of medications, but nothing seems to help you."
593,145,510,How often do you check your sugar levels?
594,145,511,Don't you consult anyone before doing that?
595,145,512,We did reevaluations of your symptoms. It turned out to be all negative. Do you smoke?
596,146,513,"It is nice to see you again, miss.  We are following up on a few things today. How is your arm feeling?"
597,146,514,How has your mood been? Are you feeling any relief from your symptoms since you have been on the Lexapro?
598,146,515,How much Lexapro are you taking now?
599,146,516,How long have you been taking the full dosage?
600,146,517,I want you to take the full dosage every day. This might be why you have not had much relief with your symptoms yet.
601,146,518,Your hands are a little shaky. Is this a normal occurrence for you?
602,146,519,It is very subtle. We will keep an eye on it for now. Your blood pressure is a little better today. Have you experienced any worsening joint or bone pain?  I want to check on your osteoporosis and osteoarthritis.
603,147,520,Do you have any past medical history?
604,148,521,How long it has been since these psychotic periods are going off and on?
605,148,522,"So, you were taking Clozaril and some other medications?"
606,148,523,"Were you feeling better with them, sir?"
607,148,524,"These antipsychotics, they were good on you, right?"
608,149,525,Does anyone in your family ever have any neurological disorder?
609,149,526,Who is in your family?
610,149,527,How old are your sisters?
611,149,528,How are they both health wise?

616,151,529,How is your foot feeling?
617,151,530,Any pain or discomfort when you walk around on it?

619,152,532,That is amazing! And are you working?
620,152,533,"Okay. So, tell me do you smoke or drink? Yes, I do both."
621,152,533,And how much would you say you smoke per day?
622,152,534,"Hm, how much do you drink?"

633,157,545,"Good, and what seems to be the problem today? Mom, can you explain for me? 
Guest_family: Well, if you look, doctor, her back posture is very rounded."
634,157,545,"I think, it's rounding about the thoracic spine. Is there a family history of this problem? 
Guest_family: Yes, on my side, my aunt and grandfather had, um, kyphosis."
635,157,545,"Yes, that's what this is. This is thoracic kyphosis to be specific. Has she seen another doctor for this? 
Guest_family: Yes, we saw another orthopedist."
636,157,545,"What did they recommend? 
Guest_family: They recommended we come in for further observation, so we're here for a second opinion."
637,157,545,"Good, is there any back pain, numbness or tingling?"
638,157,546,"Is there any weakness, numbness or tingling in your legs and arms, my dear?"
639,157,547,Are you going to the bathroom with no problem?
640,158,548,Are you allergic to anything?
641,158,549,Okay so no drug allergies.
642,159,550,"Are you married, ma'am."
643,159,551,That's wonderful. Do you drink or smoke?

645,160,553,Yes.
646,161,554,What happened to you? How did you get involved in this accident?
647,161,555,What kind of dog?
648,161,557,What did you do there?
649,161,558,And he sent you to us?
650,161,559,Okay let me examine your wound.
651,161,560,It looks like there is a flap injury developed after puncture wound. It seems like a centimeter long and viable. How old are you sir? And what ethnicity do you identify with?
652,161,561,The skin looks viable. We can save the tissue.
653,162,561,Are you aware of any family medical history?
654,162,562,"What about memory loss or stroke or high blood pressure, diabetes, or any other kind of mental illness?"

Guest_family: Nope. He is healthy."
662,165,567,"Hello! How are you all today? 
Guest_family: Not good. We are really worried about our daughter."
663,165,567,"What happened? 
Guest_family: I turned my back for one second and I saw her under the counter in the cabinet. We have childproofing on that cabinet. I don't know how she got it open. I pulled her out from the cabinet, and she had the bottle of ant bait in her hands.  She had spilled the entire bottle all over her.  She had the liquid on her hands. I don't know if she drank any of it or put her hands in her mouth."
664,165,567,"Do you know what the ant bait was called? 
Guest_family: No. I know it was the kind with Borax in it."

670,166,569,"You're right. It says here you've had some stripping of veins in your legs, a tonsillectomy, and a adenoidectomy."
671,167,569,"Is she married? 
Guest_family: Um no, she's divorced."
672,167,569,"Any history of tobacco, alcohol or drug use?  
Guest_family: I think she used to drink? But I'm not positive."
673,168,569,"And tell me, are you allergic to any medications?"
674,168,570,Okay.
675,169,570,"I'd like to get her in to see you sometime next week for her enlarged thyroid. 
Guest_clinician: Is she symptomatic?"
676,169,570,"Yes, she's experiencing increased difficulty swallowing. She's also reporting throat tightness on an off.

686,172,578,"Welcome back to the clinic, Miss A B C."
687,172,579,"It looks like we last saw you June twenty first, this year. Doctor X and Y referred you for the evaluation of your pinched nerve in the C six regain on the left side. I also see that we are following up on the significant rotator cuff tear on the left side.  Did you get scheduled for the surgery with Doctor Yen yet?"
688,172,580,How is your shoulder feeling?
689,172,581,I am sorry to hear that. Your surgery is coming up soon and that should help.
690,172,582,We are also following up the pinched nerve in your upper left extremity C six. How are you feeling?
691,172,583,Have you had any weakness associated with your upper extremities on the left side?
692,172,584,Is it about the same as the last time you were here? We have it noted in the last note that it was mild as well.
693,172,585,Any weakness or symptoms on the right side?
694,172,586,Any difficulty with mobility or moving around on either side?
695,172,587,"Have you been experiencing any bowel or, bladder dysfunction."
696,172,588,"I see in the chart for our last visit, I only had a report of a prior cervical spine M R I.  I don't have any recent images. I going to refer you for a cervical spine M R I. Are you able to get the imaging done today and I will have you return to the clinic at the end of today?"

698,173,589,Are you on any medications at this time?
699,173,590,Got it.
700,174,590,"Hey, how is the patient doing? 
Guest_clinician: I actually don't know, I was not able to examine him. He is having special procedures done for the past two hours for some medical management."
701,174,590,"Oh, I see."
702,175,590,"Yes, it is probably sinus infection and then cough secondary to that infection.
Guest_family: Will that be treatable?"
703,175,590,"Yes, it is. 
Guest_family: Okay nice."
704,176,590,You have an infection that has become septic. We are going to have to start you on intravenous antibiotics.
705,176,591,We also need to address the blood clotting. I am going to give you an anticoagulant to prevent any further clotting issues. Do you have any questions?
706,177,592,"So, what do you do for a living, sir?"
707,177,593,"Wow, that's hard work. Are you working right now?"
708,177,594,Are you married?
709,177,595,Do you two have any children?
710,177,596,"Do you smoke, sir?"
711,177,597,How about alcohol? Do you drink?
712,177,598,"How about more illicit substances, have you used illegal or prescription drugs inappropriately?"
713,177,599,That's good. Do you have any other medical conditions that run in your family that I should know about?
714,178,600,"Hello there, how are you?"
715,178,601,"So, what brings you in today?"
716,178,602,"Okay, and why do you say so?"
717,178,604,Hm.
718,178,605,"I see, are you married?"
719,178,606,I am so sorry to hear that.
720,178,607,"Okay, so tell me any weakness or dizziness or lethargy in the past or now?"
721,178,608,Any history of stroke?
722,179,609,Hi there! Welcome to the clinic.
723,179,610,"Doctor Murphy sent your records over. I reviewed the ultrasound, and we did find a kidney stone that has become stuck in the ureter on the left side. The stone is large enough to block the flow of urine from the kidney to the bladder.  How much pain are you having and where is the pain located?"
724,179,611,Okay. Let use discuss your treatment options.
725,180,612,Any allergies?
726,180,613,Are you allergic to anything?
727,181,614,You have type two Diabetes?
728,181,615,And High Cholesterol?
729,181,616,Your diabetes is poorly controlled.
730,182,617,"Can you tell me more about your daughter's injury? 
Guest_family: Well, we came in in November, and she was diagnosed with an acute on chronic right slipped capital femoral epiphysis."
731,182,617,"Did she have surgery on this? 
Guest_family: Yes, let me look at my notes, I have it written down here, um, a situ pinning."
732,182,617,"Remind me, how old are you, dear?"
733,182,618,"Okay, thank you. So, um, if you look her at the x rays, it appears that the screw is now going into the hip joint. 
Guest_family: They didn't see that before. What can we do about this?"
734,182,618,"We'll need to do another operation in order to remove this screw and put a shorter one in. We need to do the surgery because this can cause further joint damage.
Guest_family: Are there any risks of infection from this surgery?"
735,182,618,"Overall, the risk of infection is very low, honestly its less than one percent. 
Guest_family: That's good to hear, will she go to sleep during surgery?"
736,182,618,"Yes, we'll use anesthesia the entire time. She won't feel a thing. 
Guest_family: What does recovery look like for this surgery?"
737,182,618,"I expect her to heal up very well, but there's always a risk of some changes in sensation and motion, and she may be stiff for some time following everything. Other risks include bleeding, but I would not worry about these things. 
Guest_family: Okay, how does that sound, honey? Would you like to do this?"
738,183,619,What brings you in today?
739,183,620,I understand. What's bothering you the most?
740,183,621,Where's the pain located?
741,183,622,"Any recent injuries or falls? 
Guest_family: None. She spends most of her time in bed."

744,184,622,"You said you are feeling dizziness, so what makes it worse?"
745,184,623,Do these headaches change with changing the positions or standing straight?
746,184,624,"Does the patient have any known medical history?

765,187,642,"Glad to hear. So today we're going to do a comprehensive eval. It'll be a bit different than our usual visits together. Would you like your mom to step in the room, too?"
766,187,643,Alright. I'll grab her from the waiting room. I'll be right back.
767,188,643,"Okay.
Guest_clinician: Also, I am not sure if she is off Coumadin because of the surgery."
768,188,643,"Oh yeah, she has chronic AFib and she is on Coumadin. Not sure if she has stopped the medicine due to upcoming surgery.
Guest_clinician: The only thing she could tell was that she was having tremors for the past three to four years and was diagnosed with early Parkinson's disease."
769,188,643,Alright.
770,189,643,Hello. What is the reason for your visit today?
771,189,644,Were you exposed to anything recently?
772,189,645,I see. It looks like you may have been exposed to asbestos.
773,189,646,"I'll take a look, but I want to ask you a quick question. Did you have any family living with you at the time?"
774,190,647,"How are you feeling today, ma'am?"
775,190,648,Are you still having the diarrhea and decreased appetite?
776,190,649,Have you been peeing a normal amount?

785,193,658,Hello how are you? Doctor Mina is an intern working with me. She will be taking notes and discussing your case today.
786,193,659,"So, tell me Doctor Mina, what brings this young man today here?
Guest_clinician: This is a sixteen year old right handed boy. He is studying in eleventh grade. He is having some difficulties with vision like blurring and focusing. He was diagnosed with a suprasellar tumor. Later on, January fourth, he underwent a surgery for his tumor. Biopsy reports said that it was craniopharyngioma. Even after the surgery, there was some residual disease left and his visual apparatus was decompressed."
787,193,659,Thank you Doctor.  Tell me how are you doing young man? Are there any difficulties going back to school?
788,194,660,"Remind me, please, when was your surgery?"
789,194,661,"Great, we repaired that slipped capital femoral epiphysis on both sides, we call it S C F E."
790,195,662,Any medications I should know about?
791,196,663,"Is your husband still around, ma'am?"
792,196,664,I'm so sorry to hear that.

816,199,688,How did this work?
817,199,689,"Where is your pain, exactly?"
818,199,690,"Are you able to workout, or exercise, anything like that?"
819,199,691,"I see, with ten being the worst pain of all time, how would you rate your pain today?"
820,199,692,What adjectives would you use to describe the pain?
821,199,693,"Specifically, what activities make the pain worse?"
822,199,694,Does anything make the pain better?
823,199,695,"Is the pain constant, or does it come and go?"
824,199,696,Are you able to sleep at night?

836,204,709,"Oh, must be painful!"
837,205,710,Can you move your arms? I would like to see how your range of motion is.
838,205,711,"Yes, yes, looks good for both arms and legs."
839,205,712,I do not see any obvious deformities in head neck or in extremities.

852,208,721,"Okay, how has she been since that procedure?
Guest_family: Well, just look at her heel, doctor."
853,208,721,"Yes, I see. She has pretty significant calcaneal valgus deformity."
854,208,722,"Your heel is out of alignment, sweetie. Do you have pain?"
855,208,723,"Well, given all of her symptoms, I think we should do a calcaneal osteotomy and Achilles lengthening procedure. 
Guest_family: What does that procedure entail?"
856,208,723,"Well, in short, we'll go in there and straighten everything out, and get everything lined back up. 
Guest_family: What's the risk of infection with the surgery, sir?"
857,208,723,"Actually, it's less than one percent, so it's extremely low.
Guest_family: How is this possible, doctor?"
858,208,723,"We use antibiotics to control for infection the entire time. 
Guest_family: That's great. Will she be asleep for this procedure?"
859,208,723,"Yes, we'll use anesthesia the entire time. She won't feel a thing. 
Guest_family: Okay, that's good too. What about after the procedure? What's the protocol?"
860,208,723,"Well, I'll need your help. We have to be strict about her being nonweightbearing for six weeks at minimum. 
Guest_family: Will she need a brace too?"
861,208,723,"Yes, at least for six months, but if she does everything I ask of her, it will be only six months. 
Guest_family: Okay, yes, I think we should do the procedure. What do you think, honey?"
862,208,724,"The other risks include bleeding; changes in sensation in most of extremity; hardware failure; need for later hardware removal; possible nonunion; possible failure to correct all the deformity; and need for other surgical procedures.  I would not worry about these issues, though. It is quite rare. So, looking at her radiographs, the spinal arch is definitely collapsed. I think you guys are making the right decision."
863,209,724,"Good morning, young man. Are these your parents?"
864,209,725,"Good, can you tell me more about your son, please? 
Guest_family_1: Well, he's five now, and he fell onto his right arm on December fifth two thousand seven."
865,209,725,"After he fell, how was he treated? 
Guest_family_1: We went to the E D right after he fell, and they said he had complete fractures of both bones in the arm."
866,209,725,"Yes, I see that here, he also has shortening bayonet apposition. 
Guest_family_1: What can we do for this?"
867,209,725,"There's actually a few options here. First we can cast it and see how he heals, generally, children heal up very well from fractures. 
Guest_family_1: That's good, we like that option more than any kind of surgery."
868,209,725,"However, surgery is also an option here as well. 
Guest_family_1: Yeah, to be completely sure we fix this, I think we should opt for the surgery, what do you think, honey?
Guest_family_2: Yes, I agree. What are the risks of infection for this surgery?"
869,209,725,"The risk of infection is very low, generally less than one percent. We use antibiotics to control for infection. 
Guest_family_1: Will he be asleep for the surgery?"
870,209,725,"Absolutely, he won't feel a thing. Other risks include bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, hardware failure, and need for later hardware removal, and cast tightness. I would not worry about these risks. We have great results with these surgeries. 
Guest_family_1: Then yes, we'd like to do the surgery."
871,210,725,Hello. Are you a new patient?
872,210,726,That's fine. What is the reason for your visit?
873,210,727,I see. Do you know if your family has any chronic medical problems?
874,210,728,"That's good. I think I'll be able to remove it surgically. Before I go over the procedures, have you had a surgery before?"
875,210,729,"Sounds good. Other than that dark spot, you seem to be very healthy."
876,211,729,It's surgery day! How are you feeling?
877,211,730,Have you had a surgery before?
878,211,731,I see. Thank you for letting me know.

888,213,740,Do you have any kind of medical history that I should be aware of?
889,214,741,Just want to ask you few questions.
890,214,742,"Do you have any nausea, vomiting?"
891,214,743,How about fever?
892,214,744,Any blood in sputum or chest pain?
893,215,745,"Well, this is a case of hypothermia. 
Guest_family: Will he survive?"
894,215,745,"Don't worry, we will take care of him."
895,216,745,Do you take any tobacco related products?
896,216,746,What about alcohol consumption? Do you drink?
897,216,747,Are you married?
898,216,748,Are you still working?
899,217,749,Hello! What brings you back into the clinic today?
900,217,750,"I am sorry. It is likely that the increased dosage of your methothrexate is the cause of the mouth sores. Have you experienced a decreased appetite, nausea, abdominal discomfort or diarrhea?"
901,217,751,"Have you had any new rashes, or hair loss?"
902,217,752,I would like to get some bloodwork done. I would also recommend we decrease your dosage back to your previous amount. I would also like to see you back in two weeks to see how you are doing.
903,218,753,Are you aware of any medical issues in your family?
904,218,754,How about any known heart disorder or diabetes in the family.
905,219,755,"So, I am looking at his x ray and it does not show any open fracture or any kind of bone abnormality.
Guest_family: Okay, I was really worried about my son."
906,219,755,"I understand, but like I said, I didn't see any open fracture in his x ray report nor any abnormality. 
Guest_family: Okay."
907,220,755,Do you drink?
908,220,756,Do you smoke?
909,221,757,Do you live alone?
910,221,758,"Aw, what kind of cats?"
911,221,759,Are you currently working?
912,221,760,Congratulations on your retirement.
913,221,761,How long did you work as a psych aide?
914,221,762,"Incredible. One more question. Do you smoke, drink, or use drugs recreationally?"
915,221,763,Always great to hear.
916,222,763,"Hi there! What brings you in today? 
Guest_family: I think my baby got into the ant bait. I am not sure if he consumed any of it but he was under the counter and it was in his hands."
917,222,763,"What kind ant bait did he get into?
Guest_family: It was the one with Borax in it."
918,222,763,"Do you have a picture of it? 
Guest_family: Yes. It is in my phone."
919,223,763,"Good morning, ma'am. I just need to confirm some information about you before we begin today."
920,223,764,"Great, so you're sixty seven years old, and White, correct?"
921,223,765,"Thank you. Do you remember how many cycles of carboplatin and Taxol you've had for your cancer, ma'am?"
922,223,766,"Yes, I see here that your last chemo treatment on January eighteenth two thousand eight."
923,223,767,It's a uterine papillary serous carcinoma.
924,223,768,"Sure, do you have any problems today?"
925,223,769,Has this gotten worse recently?
926,223,770,That's good. Do you feel this in your toes at all?
927,223,771,"Good, do you have any tingling or burning to speak of?"
928,224,772,"How long has she had difficulty swallowing? 
Guest_family: A while now. We scheduled her to see an endocrinologist, but she's not able to get in until Monday. I wanted to see if we could get to the bottom of it now."
929,224,772,"It does appear that her thyroids are fairly enlarged. I believe that's where most of her symptoms, if not all, are stemming from. 
Guest_family: Does that mean she'll need surgery?"
930,224,772,"We'll have to see, but chances are higher since she's experiencing symptoms due to her thyroid. 
Guest_family: When will we find out?"
931,224,772,I'd like to get some imaging done and see if we can get a consult in first.
932,225,772,Do you have any significant medical conditions that run in your family that I should be aware of?
933,225,773,What about cancer? Does anyone in your family have a history of cancer?
934,226,774,"When was your injury, sir?"
935,226,775,"What do you do for a living, sir?"

941,226,781,What did they recommend about the spot?
942,226,782,"So, you've had this before? How did they know you had it?"
943,226,783,When was this?
944,226,784,Did you have surgery on this?
945,226,785,Are they still considering radiation?
946,226,786,"Okay, what does the chiropractor do for you?"
947,226,787,Has there been any improvement?
948,226,788,"That's good. Okay, so after your fall, what other treatments did you have?"
949,226,789,How did she treat you?

961,230,800,"What about your mother, or the rest of your family?"
962,231,801,Do you drink?
963,231,802,Any drugs?
964,231,803,Do you get a chance to exercise during the week?

976,234,816,We got the results back for that and it looks like it was clear then it turned bloody.
977,234,817,"Yes, they did. I see the orders for urine culture, B M P, C B C, C R P, and blood culture as well."
978,234,818,That is good. but did that help you?
979,234,819,Oh I am sorry.
980,234,820,I see that they gave you some antibiotics in E R?
981,235,821,Tell me about your medical history. Did you have any surgeries? Any medical issues in the past?
982,235,822,Do you have some record of those surgeries?
983,235,823,"That is awesome. Let me have a look. So, according to this you had L I M A to L A D coronary bypass graft. You also had had three saphenous vein grafts performed."
984,235,824,I will add all these surgeries into my record. Thank you.
985,236,824,How's everyone in your family?
986,236,825,"They are well, that is good. That's what we want."

995,239,834,"I see you have degenerative joint disease of both knees, does that ring any bells?"
996,239,835,"You have arthritis in both of your knees, sir."
997,239,836,Have you had surgery on these knees?
998,239,837,When were these surgeries?
999,239,838,How have you managed this since the surgeries?
1000,239,839,"I see. If those haven't helped, I think you'd be a good candidate for knee replacements."
1001,239,840,"No, let's do the left since that one hurts more. Do you have any other conditions I should know about?"
1002,239,841,Do you know what surgeries you've had?
1003,239,842,Who has prescribed you narcotics for this pain?
1004,240,843,Do you smoke?

1024,243,862,Is anyone else at home sick?
1025,244,863,"Hi, how are you doing, ma'am? What brings you here today?"
1026,244,864,Remind me when did you have your surgery for brain tumor?

1028,244,867,"Hi, nice to meet you."
1029,244,867,Tell me what happened.
1030,244,868,When was the second surgery? When did you get admitted?
1031,244,869,"Was there any other issue? 
Guest_family: Yeah. When she was in the rehab she developed something which they called D V T in her left calf. She did not have any such problem again after that."
1032,245,869,What medication have you tried?
1033,245,870,Pain?
1034,246,871,"Well, I am looking at your test reports and your blood sugars have been running up and down but nothing to be worried about but yeah, we need to keep monitoring. This morning it was perhaps a bit high at one hundred eighty-eight. Last time it was one hundred fifty and in one report it's around one hundred twenty and in lower teens too which is good. So, tell me how are you feeling?"
1035,246,872,"Oh boy, that's a lot going on!"
1036,246,873,"So, tell me are your hemorrhoids painful?"
1037,246,874,And are you taking anything for constipation?
1038,246,875,"Okay, let me write you an order for a laxative that should help. How bout cough? Any pain in the ribs while coughing?"
1039,246,876,Any headache or nerve pain or body pain?
1040,246,877,Any fall or imbalance problem?
1041,246,878,Any agitation or any other issues?
1042,246,879,That's good!
1043,246,880,"So, you have been seeking psychiatric help from Doctor Hudyncia right?"
1044,246,881,"She mentioned in her report that you are responding well to her treatment and that your depression is under control and the medicine is working for you. That's good news. Oh, what medicine has she prescribed? Um let me see here in the report, oh okay, got it! It's Cymbalta."
1045,246,882,"And no side effects, right?"
1046,246,883,And looks like the plan is to treat you for a minimum one year.
1047,246,884,"Lastly, any breathing issues?"
1048,247,885,"The next patient we have is Miss Dey, we have been regularly following up with her for her hydrocephalus since two thousand and two.
Guest_clinician: Oh, okay."
1049,247,885,"She also had anterior cervical corpectomy, we removed her front part of the vertebra followed by fusion from C three to C five in March two thousand and seven.
Guest_clinician: Oh wow!"
1050,247,885,"Yeah. We last saw her in March two thousand and eight at that time she was experiencing some head fullness and ringing in the ears, however we decided to leave her shunt setting at one point zero. 
Guest_clinician: Okay, then you asked her to follow up doctor X Y Z regarding her cervical spine M R I."
1051,247,885,"Yes exactly! Let's go see her. Hello Miss Dey, how are you? This is my colleague doctor Jen, and she will be accompanying me today if that is okay with you?"
1052,247,886,"So, tell me what is going on?"
1053,247,887,Okay and how do you feel this week?

1055,247,889,That's good.
1056,247,890,"And did you notice any changes regarding your bladder, do you think it is better than before or worse since the last time I saw you?"
1057,247,891,"Okay. Let's talk about your memory, any problem there, are you able to remember stuff and think about stuff?"
1058,247,892,Any headache?
1059,247,893,Any changes in your walk or balance?

1062,247,896,Are you using cane at this point of time?
1063,247,897,Okay good. Anything else you want to tell me?
1064,247,898,"Oh okay, do you feel any tingling or numbness."
1065,247,899,Okay.
1066,247,900,"Doctor Jen did you take the notes of what she said? 
Guest_clinician: I did."
1067,247,900,"Okay great, anything else Miss Dey?"
1068,247,901,Alright you take care. I will see you next time.
1069,247,902,"Bye. 
Guest_clinician: Take care Miss Dey, Bye!"
1070,248,902,"So, you saw Doctor X?"
1071,248,903,"Yes, I will look at C B C diff and C M P profile."
1072,248,904,"Yeah, I couldn't get hold of Doctor Z but here is the phone number. You should book the appointment."
1073,248,905,"Also, I would like to follow up with your endocrinologist that is Doctor A for adjustments that is needed in your insulin pump."
1074,248,906,"Yes, please follow up with Doctor B for issues with your J tube."
1075,248,907,"Lastly, I want you to see Doctor Y if your condition changes regarding colon cancer."
1076,249,907,I see here that you were in for afib last month.
1077,249,908,How're you doing?
1078,249,909,That's good to hear. Are you still taking Metoprolol and Premarin?
1079,250,910,Any health problems I should note?
1080,250,911,Type one or two?
1081,250,912,Are you on insulin?
1082,251,913,"Let me examine your leg. Well your x ray looks fine. No defect there, I don't see any mass or swelling. Are you able to walk or use that leg at all?"
1083,251,914,"Good, so your muscle strength is good, no loss of muscle tone there."
1084,252,915,"Hello, how are you?"
1085,252,916,"So, what is going on with you?"
1086,252,917,Okay.
1087,253,917,How long have you had this cough?
1088,253,918,Are you bringing anything up when you cough?
1089,253,919,Any shortness of breath or chest pain?
1090,253,920,How about fevers or chills?
1091,254,921,Let's go over your history.
1092,254,922,I see that you had an appendectomy.
1093,254,923,Any complications with either surgery?
1094,254,924,I also see that you have a recurring history of pneumonia.
1095,254,925,How often have you had pneumonia?
1096,254,926,Have you ever been hospitalized due to pneumonia?
1097,254,927,I see.
1098,254,928,"Any history of inherited lung disease, bronchiectasis, or other chronic pulmonary cause for repeated pneumonia?"
1099,254,929,"And you recently saw the urologist, correct?"
1100,254,930,Do you have a history of diabetes or other medical problems?
1101,255,931,Hi again! How are you feeling today?
1102,255,932,Are you still experiencing any nausea or vomiting?
1103,255,933,Have you had any shortness of breath or chest pain?
1104,255,934,Any painful or burning urination?
1105,255,935,Do you have a history of any seizure disorder?
1106,256,936,Tell me about your family medical history.
1107,257,937,"Your son had his circumcision performed here at Children's Hospital, correct? 
Guest_family: Yes, doctor."
1108,257,937,"Do you remember the date of that procedure? 
Guest_family: Um, it was on September sixteenth two thousand seven."
1109,257,937,"Good, the procedure went well. He had some phimosis, but the operation was quite smooth otherwise. 
Guest_family: What's phimosis?"
1110,257,937,"That's tightness of the foreskin. It sometimes makes the procedure more difficult, but everything went smoothly. 
Guest_family: Oh, that's good to hear."
1111,257,937,"He also had a little bit of bleeding when he woke up in the recovery room, so we had to put in some additional sutures. 
Guest_family: Okay, thank you for taking care of him."
1112,257,937,"It's my pleasure. Has he been taking his pain medicine? 
Guest_family: He took them for a couple days, but he really seems back to normal now. He doesn't seem to be in any pain."
1113,257,937,"Great, does he have any difficulty urinating? 
Guest_family: No, that's normal."
1114,257,937,"Bowel movements? How are they?
Guest_family: That's normal too, doctor."
1115,258,937,Is this something new? Or have you had it before?
1116,258,938,What exactly are you feeling?
1117,258,939,Okay. How old are you?
1118,258,940,Okay let me see how we can evaluate that.
1119,259,940,"So, I think we need to start you on antibiotics for that ulcer on your right foot and possible osteomyelitis. I will send a prescription to your pharmacy."
1120,260,941,"Your condition is improved, and you look pretty stable."
1121,261,942,Do you have any allergies to medications?
1122,262,943,Looks like you have a U T I and I need to give you some antibiotics to treat it.
1123,262,944,I will write you a prescription for Macrobid. Are you still using the Walgreens pharmacy at Thrashers Corner?
1124,262,945,Are you taking any other medications?
1125,262,946,"Pravachol for my cholesterol. Wow, thank you for that, it helps a lot. Let me make a note of it."
1126,263,947,Have you had any operations in the-
1127,263,948,How about any past injuries or illnesses?
1128,264,949,What is going on?
1129,264,950,How bad is it?
1130,265,951,Have you taken any medications in the past?
1131,265,952,Either of those.
1132,266,953,Any changes to your diet?
1133,266,954,How're you feeling since starting this diet?
1134,267,955,Hello! How are you doing?
1135,267,956,Tell me about your past medical history.
1136,267,957,Are you still undergoing treatment?
1137,267,958,Do you have any other medical conditions?
1138,267,959,Do you take medication for the G E R D?
1139,268,960,"Hello, miss. Before we begin your physical, could you verify your age and ethnicity for me, please?"
1140,268,961,"Thank you. I also see that you're here for a follow up for your asthma, correct? How is your asthma?"
1141,268,962,"Oh, no. Has anything changed that may have made your allergies worse?"
1142,268,963,Are you taking any medications to alleviate your asthma and allergies?
1143,268,964,Let me take a look. I see you have been taking Allegra for your allergies. Has that been helping?
1144,268,965,You don't take it every day then?
1145,268,966,I see. What about the Flonase? Has that been helping?
1146,268,967,"I also see you took Advair in the past, correct? Do you still take it?"
1147,268,968,I understand. Speaking more on this. Let's begin your physical. Do you have anything you'd like to add that you're starting to notice more?
1148,268,969,I see. Do you see any other increased symptoms right before your menstrual cycle?
1149,268,970,When do you see your mood change?
1150,268,971,Have you seen any bleeding during your cycle?
1151,268,972,I see. What about hot flashes or night sweats?
1152,268,973,"That's good. I'm looking at your chart right now and it says you showed a U T I present, correct? Your test showed blood in your urine."
1153,268,974,Has your urine been checked since then?
1154,268,975,I see. I'll order another urine test along with additional lab tests so that we can complete your physical.
1155,268,976,"Oh, perfect. I see they looked at your cholesterol and other areas. Could you send that to me when you get the results?"
1156,269,977,"How are your parents doing, sir?"
1157,269,978,"I'm so sorry to hear that, sir. How about your brothers?"
1158,269,979,"Remind me, please, how old are they?"
1159,269,980,That's great. Do you have any medical conditions that run in your family?
1160,269,981,"Oh no, thank you for telling me."
1161,269,982,"Do you have any children, sir?"
1162,269,983,How old are your sons?
1163,269,984,"In addition to the neonatal deaths, do you have any other conditions that I should know about?"
1164,270,985,"Hello, ma'am. What is the reason for your visit today?"
1165,270,986,"Thank you. Let me take a look.  I see here it says you had severe sinusitis two to three months ago, correct?"
1166,270,987,"Yeah, it is. Sinusitis is the inflammation of your nasal airways."
1167,270,988,No problem. Would you be able to describe to me what you had been feeling two to three months ago?
1168,270,989,Have you ever been prescribed any medication?
1169,270,990,"I see you were given antibiotics, correct?"
1170,270,991,Antibiotics are usually used to fight infections.
1171,270,992,Your report states you had a severe infection. Do you remember if the antibiotics helped?
1172,270,993,I see. Did your doctor order any advanced imaging's?
1173,270,994,"Let me take a look. It looks like you had some thickening of the mucosal layer in your right paranasal sinus. You also had some obstruction in your right ostiomeatal complex and excess growing of some of the bones in your nose. Uhm. Oh, one more thing. I see your nasal septum was shifted to the left."
1174,270,995,"No problem. Going back to your list of medications, I know you took antibiotics for your infection, but did you take any medication for your sinuses?"
1175,270,996,I see. Looks like the cream you used was a topical nasal corticosteroid. Are there any other symptoms that you have been experiencing?
1176,270,997,I see. Let's perform an audiogram test to check your ears.
1177,270,998,I'm seeing that you have some mild high frequency sensorineural hearing loss. Your tympanometry seems to be normal. Your speech discrimination was also normal.
1178,270,999,I want to ask a few more questions about your ears. Do you feel any fullness or pressure?
1179,270,1000,"Do you hear any humming, buzzing, or roaring sounds?"
1180,270,1001,"We checked your ears and now understand more about the problem, but I wonder why your balance is affected. When did you start noticing your balance was affected?"
1181,270,1002,Was the medicine called Allegra?
1182,270,1003,I see. Did you ever feel any dizziness too?
1183,270,1004,I will have you do some movements to see if your dizziness occurs.
1184,270,1005,Could you look to the left and then look to the right.
1185,270,1006,Looks like sudden movements and head turning make your dizziness worse.
1186,271,1006,Is there anyone that lives with you at home? You are going to need someone to help you care for your wound.
1187,272,1007,Hello. Looks like you're having surgery today.
1188,272,1008,I'm looking at it right now. Looks like you had a PermCath inserted three times and received peritoneal dialysis
1189,273,1008,"So, what is happening with you?"
1190,273,1009,Okay and in one or both knees?
1191,273,1010,Okay.
1192,274,1010,Hi!
1193,274,1011,How are you feeling now?
1194,274,1012,"Yeah, looks like your condition is improving."
1195,275,1013,"And who are we seeing today?
Guest_family: Hi Doctor, this my son J and that's my wife. 
Guest_family_2: Hi there"
1196,275,1013,"Well, hello young man how are you feeling today?
Guest_family_2: He has been complaining of severe tummy pain and was crying the whole time. We are worried as he is a special child. He has autism."
1197,275,1013,"For how long now?
Guest_family_2: Autism?"
1198,275,1013,"No, I mean when did he start complaining of stomach pain?
Guest_family_2: It started last night."
1199,275,1013,"Oh okay, let me check him. Did he have any nausea or vomiting?
Guest_family: Yes, he threw up a lot and is refusing to eat or drink anything."
1200,275,1013,"And then he is complaining of tummy pain?
Guest_family_2: Yes."
1201,275,1013,"Well, the good part is he is not dehydrated."
1202,275,1013,"Any diarrhea?
Guest_family_2: Yes, he went three to four times."
1203,275,1013,"Hm, but no blood or anything in the stools or vomit?
Guest_family: No, nothing like that, we did not notice anything."
1204,275,1013,Okay good.
1205,275,1013,"Well, let me run some tests but the signs and symptoms sound like he might have a stomach flu, also called as gastroenteritis in medical terms. I will start him on some medicines and hopefully that should help."
1206,276,1013,"Hello, nice to meet you, miss. I will be taking care of you today. Before we start, can I get to know you a bit? I like to know who I am treating."
1207,276,1014,"I am sorry to hear that, but I am glad you are happy after retirement. Do you celebrate your infinite days off with a drink or a cigarette?"
1208,276,1015,Do you have any children that you spend your time with?
1209,277,1016,What do you use to treat your asthma?
1210,278,1017,Do you eat three meals a day?
1211,278,1018,Do you think those meals add up to about two thousand calories a day?
1212,279,1019,Are you still taking Micronase every morning?
1213,279,1020,"Great. Continue taking Micronase by mouth every day. As for your infection, I want you to start taking Bactrim twice daily. I'll be prescribing you thirty pills. It'll be Bactrim four hundred M G and eighty M G tablets."
1214,280,1020,Do you consume any kind of tobacco?
1215,280,1021,What about smoking?
1216,280,1022,Any kind of alcohol consumption?
1217,281,1023,What seems to be the problem today?
1218,281,1024,How long have you been having these headaches?
1219,281,1025,"Did you suddenly start having them, or was it more gradual?"
1220,281,1026,Where do you feel your headaches?
1221,281,1027,How would you describe your symptoms?
1222,281,1028,What's the intensity of these headaches?
1223,281,1029,Do these headaches interfere with your ability to do your activities?
1224,281,1030,Do you have any sinus congestion?
1225,281,1031,Are you stressed out at work?
1226,281,1032,Are you sleeping well?
1227,281,1033,"Do you have any oral symptoms, like vomiting or pain in your jaw?"
1228,282,1034,Do you have any medical conditions that I should know about?
1229,282,1035,"So, there's no history of depression, or cancer, or high blood pressure?"
1230,283,1037,"Hm, any nausea or vomiting?"
1231,284,1038,Have you been experiencing any mental difficulties or confusion?
1232,284,1039,Any hallucinations? Are you seeing hearing thing that is not real?
1233,285,1040,"Good afternoon, which gender do you identify with?"
1234,285,1041,"Great, thank you. Have you ever had surgery on this knee?"
1235,285,1042,"I see, thank you. What about your upper body? Is there any history of surgery there?"
1236,286,1043,"Welcome in, sir."
1237,286,1044,What do you do for work?
1238,286,1045,What do you teach?
1239,286,1046,Do you drink alcohol or use tobacco products?
1240,286,1047,Okay.
1241,287,1047,Do you have any major medical conditions that I should know about?
1242,287,1048,"I'm seeing here that you have a history of allergies too, is that correct?"
1243,288,1049,He's stable. Heart rate sixty five. Normal rhythm. Oxygen ninety seven percent on room air.
1244,289,1049,Tell me about your past problems.
1245,289,1050,"Yes it says here that you have bladder problems from a long time, mostly related to tone and capacity."
1246,289,1051,Okay and you have recently had right side C V A?
1247,289,1052,Okay. Good.
1248,289,1053,Okay and your neural problem is associated to that as well.
1249,289,1054,You have pain on the right side now?
1250,289,1055,And you take thyroid medications too?
1251,289,1056,Okay.
1252,289,1057,What surgeries have you had in the past?
1253,289,1058,"And now pacemaker placement, right?"
1254,290,1059,Do you have any major medical conditions running in your family history that you know about?
1255,290,1060,"So, there's no history of arthritis, or cancer that you're aware of?"
1256,291,1061,"So, does high blood pressure run in your family?"
1257,291,1062,Okay and this was your first time?
1258,291,1063,Because I am looking at your previous charts and I don't see it mentioned before.
1259,292,1064,"Now, let's talk about your family history. Have any of them had cancer?"
1260,292,1065,That's okay. What about heart disease? Can you remember anyone having that?
1261,292,1066,"Thank you, has anyone in your family had a joint replacement?"
1262,293,1067,"Hi, how are you?"
1263,293,1068,"Well, I am good too, thank you for asking. So, what brings you here?"
1264,293,1069,"Oh, let me take a look. Which side?"
1265,293,1070,"Okay, I see it. Looks like you have developed pressure ulcer."
1266,294,1070,"Okay, tell me what's going on and what's brought you here. 
Guest_family: I am her mother. She has this blister on the side of her head right above her ear, here. I was just worried and concerned about my baby."
1267,294,1070,"How old is the baby? When did you first notice it?
Guest_family: She is just fourteen days old. Let me tell you from the beginning. On Friday, when I was taking her for a bath, I noticed a blister near her umbilicus area. We went to our doctor on Saturday, and they did a test."
1268,294,1070,"Did you get the test result?
Guest_family: I got it today. Here is the report."
1269,294,1070,"Okay, let me have a look. It says she is having a growing M R S A.
Guest_family: Yeah, I've been diagnosed with that too. And I am on medications. I had it on my buttock area."
1270,294,1070,"Okay, so you know about it, and I don't have to explain it more.
Guest_family: Yeah."
1271,294,1070,"So how is the blister on the umbilicus now?
Guest_family: She has been doing good. We put on some bacitracin ointment, and it almost healed up. But today I noticed that another small blister on her head. It really scared me, and I did not want to take any chance. That's why I reached out to the Infectious Disease center. I know it is private. But still, I don't want to take any chance with my baby's health. I called the center directly and they asked me to come to the hospital."
1272,294,1070,"You did good. I will start the treatment. How are her eating and sleeping habits?
Guest_family: She hasn't missed any of her meals. She is taking around two ounces of milk in every feed. I don't think I have any issues with her eating or sleeping."
1273,294,1070,"Did she have any fever?
Guest_family: Not that I noticed."
1274,294,1070,"Has she been lethargic or crying more than normal?
Guest_family: No."
1275,294,1070,"Any other changes in her daily routine that you might have noticed?
Guest_family: No, I didn't notice any changes."
1276,295,1071,Is it in any side of head or is it overall?
1277,295,1072,This sounds like it is a migraine headache.
1278,296,1072,"Good afternoon, young man. Is this your mother?"
1279,296,1073,"Good, can you tell me more about your son, ma'am?
Guest_family: Sure, well, he's six years old now, and we're here to follow up his A D H D medicines."
1280,296,1073,"He's been taking Adderall, correct? How long has he been taking this?
Guest_family: It's been about a month now."
1281,296,1073,"How has he responded to the Adderall?
Guest_family: The first day he took it, truthfully, he was wonderful. There's been a lot of improvement in his behavior, and he's really been doing well, so far."
1282,296,1073,"That's great!
Guest_family: Yes, but I have two concerns. When he takes the medicine first thing in the morning it seems to take a while to kick in, and then it wears off at about two P M and he has problems in the evening."
1283,296,1073,"Has he had problems with his appetite? 
Guest_family: Um, he did at first, but it's been coming back. It's more of a problem in the morning when he first takes the medicine in the morning, not so much in the afternoon after it wears off."
1284,296,1073,"Have you gotten any reports from his teachers? 
Guest_family: They have seen a dramatic improvement with it."
1285,296,1073,"Has he taken every dose?
Guest_family: Well, I missed one last weekend, and he was just horrible."
1286,297,1074,"Good afternoon, sir. Welcome in. Let's get started, how old are you?"
1287,297,1075,"My nurse says that you're here for an independent evaluation, is that correct?"
1288,297,1076,"Good, what do you do for a living?"
1289,297,1077,What do you do there?
1290,297,1078,That's hard work. When did you get hurt?
1291,297,1079,"Do you have a history of back problems, like before this injury?"
1292,297,1080,What happened when you got hurt this time?
1293,297,1081,What kind of pain did you feel?
1294,297,1082,Does your pain go down your legs?
1295,297,1083,How have your symptoms progressed since they began?
1296,297,1084,Do you have any pain in your left leg?
1297,297,1085,What other symptoms are you having besides the pain down your leg?
1298,297,1086,Have you seen another doctor for this?
1299,297,1087,What did they do for you?
1300,297,1088,Did this help at all?
1301,297,1089,Who else have you seen?
1302,297,1090,When did you see them?
1303,297,1091,What did they recommend?
1304,297,1092,"Okay, this M R I report is basically negative, which is good. Did he give you any medications?"
1305,297,1093,"Wow, that's strong stuff. What is your work status right now?"
1306,297,1094,"I'm reading your notes from doctor X Y Z, he says he released you in June, and that you have reached maximum medical improvement."
1307,297,1095,"When you went for follow up, did you still have that pain down your legs?"
1308,297,1096,What did doctor X Y Z recommend at that time?
1309,297,1097,Did you have this done?
1310,297,1098,Did this help at all?
1311,297,1099,"Okay, so after that, what treatment did you have?"
1312,297,1100,Do you have the results of that as well?
1313,297,1101,"Okay, sir, these tests are essentially normal, which is more good news. What aggravates your pain?"
1314,297,1102,"When you sit for a long time, is it in both legs?"
1315,297,1103,Are you able to sleep at night?
1316,297,1104,Have you been able to return to work?
1317,297,1105,"Finally, have you seen a chiropractor for this pain?"
1318,297,1106,Did they do anything to help you feel better?
1319,298,1107,Is there any family medical history?
1320,298,1108,"Wow, that sure is a list. Anyone with diabetes?"
1321,299,1109,"Does he have any known drug allergies? 
Guest_family: No."
1322,300,1109,"Good morning, can you tell me more about your son, ma'am. 
Guest_family: Sure, he's forty six, White, and he has Down syndrome."
1323,300,1109,"Great, thank you. Is he still having problems with his hypothyroidism and onychomycosis? 
Guest_family: Yes, that's correct doctor."
1324,300,1109,"Has he remained complaint with his Lamisil? 
Guest_family: Yes, he's taken six weeks of it with no problems."
1325,300,1109,"Good, so we'll do an A L T blood test today.
Guest_family: Why is that doctor?"
1326,300,1109,"Well, at his last appointment in April, he had an elevated T S H level. So, we should recheck that today. 
Guest_family: Yes, I remember that."
1327,300,1109,"Has he been taking his Levothroid daily as well? 
Guest_family: Yes, he has, he doesn't like it, but I help him with it, and he eventually takes it."
1328,300,1109,"Good, thanks for taking care of him, Mom.  
Guest_family: Oh, it's my job."
1329,300,1109,"Does he take any other medications? 
Guest_family: He has some medicated eye drops for his cornea."
1330,301,1109,Do you have any questions regarding your surgery?
1331,301,1110,Go ahead shoot.
1332,302,1111,"How about any drugs, alcohol, or tobacco?"
1333,303,1112,"Hey, how are you?"
1334,303,1113,So you do not have any more nausea or vomiting?
1335,303,1114,How about any acidity?
1336,303,1115,Great.
1337,304,1115,How are you?
1338,304,1116,That's great. You are stable.
1339,304,1117,"Yes, you can."
1340,305,1118,"Good afternoon, young man, are these your parents?"
1341,305,1119,"Can you tell me more about your son, please? 
Guest_family: Well, he is seven years old, and he has had diarrhea for four days, and he's been throwing up for three days."
1342,305,1120,"How many times has he had diarrhea per day since this began? 
Guest_family: Well, it's been about five or six times a day for the last four days."
1343,305,1120,"How many times has he thrown up per day?
Guest_family: Um, it has been frequent."
1344,305,1120,Has he been throwing up today?
1345,305,1121,Has he gone to the bathroom today?
1346,305,1122,"Has he had any fever symptoms?
Guest_family: Yes, he had a fever of one hundred three last night."
1347,305,1122,Has he eaten any solid food?
1348,305,1123,"Was he able to keep the food down?
Guest_family: No, he threw it up."
1349,305,1123,"What has he drank? 
Guest_family: Um, Pedialyte, Gatorade, white grape juice, and seven up, the soda."
1350,306,1123,Welcome into the clinic! I would like to start with your past medical history.
1351,306,1124,Okay.  What brings you in today?
1352,306,1125,How long has this been going on?
1353,306,1126,Have you had a fever?
1354,306,1127,Does the abdominal pain come during one of these coughing episodes?
1355,307,1128,"Good afternoon, dear, how old are you?"
1356,307,1129,"Good, and what brings you in for a visit today?"
1357,307,1130,"Oh no, how long has this knee been hurting you?"
1358,307,1131,Have you seen another doctor for this?
1359,307,1132,"I see, and what did this doctor recommend?
Guest_family: We got an MRI, I have a disc with the images, and the report as well right here, if you want to take a look at it."
1360,307,1132,"Thank you, yes, so this shows left patellar chondromalacia. Has she been to P T?
Guest_family: We got a referral for P T, but they only wanted to do, um, let me look at my notes, patellar tracking exercises."
1361,307,1132,"I see, has she been wearing her brace? 
Guest_family: Yes, she has been. I've been making sure of it."
1362,307,1132,"That's good, and how is your pain today, dear?"
1363,307,1133,"Well, we're in a pretty difficult spot here. The majority of my patients get significantly better by just going to P T. 
Guest_family: Is there any surgery to fix this?"
1364,307,1133,"Usually, we manage this for six months without surgery, and she hasn't reached that milestone yet. But, because her pain is getting so severe, I can do a lateral capsular release on this knee. 
Guest_family: What is that?"
1365,307,1133,"It's a small procedure, minimally invasive, and we can do it outpatient. Her kneecap is partially dislocating, so this surgery will get everything back into alignment. 
Guest_family: Okay, what is the risk of infection?"
1366,307,1133,The risk of infection is actually less than one percent. We use antibiotics to control for infection.
1367,307,1134,"Yes, you won't feel a thing."
1368,307,1135,"Yes, you'll need to go some after the surgery to make sure everything heals up okay. The other risks include bleeding, changes in sensation and motion extremity, failure of procedure to relieve pain, need for postoperative rehab, and significant postoperative swelling.
Guest_family: I think we'd like to do the surgery. What do you think, honey?"
1369,308,1136,What brings you here today?
1370,308,1137,When did you first notice it?
1371,309,1138,"Welcome to the clinic., ma'am"
1372,309,1139,What brings you into see me?
1373,309,1140,How long has this been going on for?
1374,309,1141,In these past four months have your symptoms becomes worse or has it improved at all?
1375,309,1142,"Have you experienced any pain or numbness in your arm, wrist, or hand?"
1376,309,1143,The right hand and the first and second finger?
1377,309,1144,How old are you?
1378,309,1145,Are you left or right handed?
1379,309,1146,Have you had any other pain anywhere else in your body?
1380,309,1147,"Did you experience any trauma neck, head or back?"
1381,309,1148,Any pain or symptoms in your left arm or shoulder?
1382,309,1149,Have you had any visual changes or disturbances?
1383,309,1150,Any difficulties with your bowels or your bladder?
1384,309,1151,Have you been taking any thing for the pain?
1385,309,1152,Has the Naprosyn help relieve your pain?
1386,309,1153,Okay.
1387,310,1153,Is this baby number two?
1388,310,1154,"How many times have you been pregnant, including miscarriages or abortions if any?"
1389,310,1155,When was your last period?
1390,310,1156,"And how would you describe your periods? Light, normal, heavy?"
1391,310,1157,Any abnormal pap smears?
1392,310,1158,That's wonderful to hear. And my last question for you is if you've ever gotten a mammogram?
1393,310,1159,"It depends. For example, the recommended age would be younger for someone who has a family history of breast cancer. Given that you don't have a positive family history of breast cancer, I'd advise getting one in a few years at the age of forty five."
1394,311,1159,"Okay, I want you to follow up with our hand therapist Doctor X at her A B C D office in one to two weeks."
1395,312,1160,So we're here to follow up on a few things. I'd like to know how you're keeping up with your blood sugar checks.
1396,312,1161,Have you been keeping a log?
1397,312,1162,Do you have the log with you today?
1398,312,1163,Great.
1399,312,1164,Thank you. And have you been watching your cholesterol intake since getting blood work done? Your labs show your cholesterol levels are a bit elevated. I'd like for you to monitor your cholesterol and go in for another set of labs before our next visit.
1400,312,1165,"Yes, you'll need to fast. I'd recommend going in early in the morning before eating any breakfast."
1401,312,1166,"And as for your sinusitis, how have you been feeling since finishing your course of antibiotics?"
1402,313,1167,What brings you in today?
1403,313,1168,Do you have any other symptoms?
1404,313,1169,Do you have any history of kidney stones?
1405,314,1170,"A little over a year ago. She received antibiotic therapy and ended up having debridement and instrumentation with Doctor XYZ.  
Guest_clinician: How's she doing today?"
1406,314,1170,"Really quite well. 
Guest_clinician: She also had a P E with that prior hospitalization, correct?"
1407,314,1170,Yes.
1408,315,1170,Do you have sugar or blood pressure problems?
1409,315,1171,Good. Any other health issues?

1420,319,1181,Do you live alone or with others?
1421,319,1182,Do you smoke cigarettes?
1422,319,1183,That's great! When did you quit?

1435,322,1195,When did that start happening?
1436,322,1196,Is the blurred vision an all blur or is there a blind spot of blurred vision.
1437,322,1197,Have you had any fluctuations in your symptoms in the last year? Have you gained any vision back?
1438,322,1198,"Have you experienced any weakness, dizziness, vertigo, nausea or vomiting?"

1440,322,1200,Any pain in or behind the eye at all?
1441,322,1201,Any other health concerns or complains?
1442,322,1202,Alright! Let me take a look here.

1459,325,1217,Do you remember the name of the medication you are taking?
1460,325,1218,"That is fine, we will figure it out."
1461,326,1218,I wanted to talk to you about your family medical history.
1462,326,1219,Family history plays an invaluable role in your health. It provides us with important clues and insight to predict and detect diseases before obvious symptoms appear.
1463,327,1220,"Okay, let's review your family history."
1464,327,1221,Does anyone in your family have high blood pressure or high cholesterol?

1499,334,1254,I'm going to touch both of your breasts one by one to check for any lump or kind of mass. Okay?
1500,334,1255,"Okay, so both looks good. Are you feeling any pain while I'm touching?"
1501,334,1256,"That's good, no masses, no pain and I do not feel anything in your armpit area."
1502,335,1256,How's your wife doing? I think the last time I saw her was two weeks ago. She was telling me about the remodeling you've been doing around the house.
1503,335,1257,"Yeah, it can take some time. We remodeled our kitchen three years ago and it turned our lives upside down. So tell me, how's training going for you? I believe you were telling me that you have a five k coming up."

1512,336,1266,Are you having trouble sleeping at night?
1513,336,1267,"With ten being the worst pain imaginable, how would you rate your pain today?"
1514,336,1268,"When it's the worst, how would you rate it?"
1515,336,1269,Do you take any medicines for this pain?

1526,338,1280,How have you been feeling? How is your leg feeling?
1527,338,1281,It looks like we have you taking Vicodin for the pain. Is the medication not helping?
1528,338,1282,I'll note that. Vomiting since February nineteen of two thousand seven. I am sorry to hear that. I will make a change to the medication and get you something for the constipation issue.
1529,338,1283,"Have you had any shortness of breath, chest pain or coughing up blood?"
1530,338,1284,"Any joint pain, headaches or rashes?"

1547,345,1300,"Wow, they were quite young. I offer you my sincerest condolences."
1548,345,1301,That's all you can do. It's important to spend time with each other every chance you get.
1549,345,1302,I have a few more questions to ask before we end today.

1579,351,1332,Do you have any children?
1580,351,1333,"That's wonderful, how are your sons doing?"
1581,351,1334,"That's great, what about your daughters?"
1582,351,1335,"I'm sorry, that must be so hard to deal with. Are there any other conditions you're aware of?"
1583,352,1336,Are you married?
1584,352,1337,Where do you work?
1585,352,1338,Do you smoke or drink? Have you ever tried any illegal drug?
1586,353,1339,It looks like E M S found you in bad shape?
1587,353,1340,"Did your mother tell you anything about her condition before E M S arrived? 
Guest_family: She said she threw up right before they came and she had diarrhea."
1588,353,1340,Ma'am. How are you feeling now?
1589,353,1341,How many times did you vomit ma'am?

1594,354,1346,Do you smoke cigarettes or drink?
1595,355,1347,"How's the little dude?
Guest_family: He has fever and bad congestion for the last two days. He has had a fever for one. I try to suck the discharge out through nose."
1596,355,1347,"I am guessing he has some mild problems with breathing while feeding.
Guest_family: Yes, that is correct. He is drinking milk every couple hours, only for ten minutes instead of twenty minutes.
Guest_family: He has fever too, so she gave him Tylenol.
Guest_family2: He is very fussy."
1597,355,1347,"Is he sleeping well? 
Guest_family: Yes, he sleeps. But he is not able to breath well even with albuterol."
1598,355,1347,"How about wet and dirty diapers?
Guest_family: He is peeing less I think because he used to have eight to ten wet diapers but now it's down to four in a day. And five dirty diapers."
1599,355,1347,"How about any diarrhea?
Guest_family: No, he doesn't have any diarrhea, they are soft and yellow."
1600,355,1347,"Any rashes or acne?
Guest_family: No."
1601,355,1347,"How about vomiting?
Guest_family: No, he did not vomit."
1602,355,1347,"How old is he? And, sorry this is odd, but what ethnicity do you identify as? I need it foe the paperwork. 
Guest_family: Twenty one days old Caucasian male."
1603,355,1347,"Do you notice him getting blue at all? Or does this area sink in when he tried to breathe?
Guest_family: No, neither."
1604,355,1347,"Is he having any trouble breathing in general?
Guest_family: No."
1605,356,1347,Are you taking Benicar?
1606,356,1348,And what else?
1607,356,1349,Okay that's good information.
1608,357,1349,Do you smoke?
1609,357,1350,How about alcohol intake?
1610,357,1351,What about any kind of drug usage?
1611,358,1352,"Hi, how are you?"
1612,358,1353,Do you have any bone pain or issues around that?
1613,358,1354,"So, they gave you a dose of Tylenol here in the emergency department to treat your pain.  Is your pain under control?"
1614,358,1355,"Okay, let's get you off. Yeah, your C T scans of the abdomen appeared normal.  And there was no sign of bleeding.  I believe, you just have a contusion and abrasion to abdomen from the seatbelt and likely from the airbag as well."
1615,358,1356,It's good that you can stand and walk through the emergency department without difficulty. I do not see any abrasions or lacerations.
1616,359,1357,"Lets talk about your family history, does cancer run in your family ma'am?"
1617,359,1358,Oh wow!
1618,359,1359,And you mentioned that your mother had Alzheimer's?
1619,359,1361,"Okay, how about your siblings, do they have any signs of Alzheimer?"
1620,359,1362,Okay.
1621,360,1362,"I have here hypertension, diabetes, diabetic retinopathy, and elevated lipids. They're in post C V A.
Guest_clinician: Do you know their neurologist?"
1622,360,1362,"I can have the nurse or scribe go in and ask again. 
Guest_clinician: Great."
1623,361,1362,"I tried but was unsuccessful. She's very out of it. 
Guest_clinician: Does she have a history of alcohol abuse?"
1624,361,1362,"According to her records, she has a long history of alcohol abuse."
1625,362,1362,"The patient has a history of C A D. 
Guest_clinician: Are they being followed by a cardiologist?"
1626,362,1362,Not to my knowledge. I can check their electronic medical records. One sec.
1627,363,1362,"Hi sir, how old are you?"
1628,363,1363,"We are following up today for your moderate to severe apnea, right?"
1629,363,1364,Okay and you did the CPAP?
1630,363,1365,"Okay, let's review it today."

1636,365,1372,Do you have any cramping or clotting?
1637,365,1373,"What color is your discharge, ma'am?"
1638,365,1374,"Okay, have you had sex again yet?"
1639,365,1375,Are you going to the bathroom regularly?
1640,365,1376,Are you constipated?
1641,365,1377,That'll also do it.
1642,365,1378,What symptoms do you have with your allergies?
1643,366,1379,Do you have any major medical conditions that run in your family that I should know about?
1644,366,1380,"Well, it could be anything from diabetes to high blood pressure to cancer."
1645,367,1381,"Hi, how are you?"
1646,367,1382,I am so sorry. Tell me about your back.
1647,367,1383,How did you land when you fell?
1648,367,1384,I would like to get some imaging done today.
1649,368,1385,Have you seen your lab results?
1650,368,1386,"Yes, I have them right here. They're essentially negative, except it appears that you had C difficile in the past. Do you remember that?"
1651,368,1387,"Yeah, its unfortunately more common there."
1652,369,1387,"Breath in breath out, let me tap it and see. Well, your lungs sound clear."
1653,370,1388,Are you still taking the Trizivir?
1654,370,1389,How much are you taking?
1655,370,1390,Are you taking any other medications?
1656,371,1391,"I just need to confirm some information before we begin sir, you're forty one, correct?"
1657,371,1392,"Good, so what happened?"
1658,371,1393,How did you fall?
1659,371,1394,Where is your left shoulder pain?
1660,371,1395,"Going backwards a little, how about the right shoulder?"
1661,371,1396,"Good, do you have any pain in the front of the shoulder?"
1662,371,1397,"Good, how about weakness? Is there any shoulder weakness?"
1663,371,1398,"How have your symptoms progressed over the last two days? Have they gotten better, or worse?"
1664,371,1399,Have you been able to do any activities?
1665,371,1400,"Good, what medicines have you taken for this?"
1666,372,1401,Hi there! It is good to see you both. How has everything been going for the both of you?
1667,372,1402,"That is great. Keep me updated on her progress.  Her bloodwork came back showing an underactive thyroid. This explains the recent weight gain and fatigue. I would like to start her on a medication called levothyroxine. We will need to check her bloodwork again in one month to see how her thyroid respond to the medication. 
Guest_family: Okay."
1668,372,1402,"Is there any other concerns you have today? 
Guest_family: Yes. She has this toenail that looks strange and discolored."
1669,372,1402,Let me look. Can you remove your socks for me?
1670,372,1403,"Is it this nail? 
Guest_family: Yes."
1671,372,1403,"This is very common. It is called Onychomycosis. It is nail fungus. Since only one nail is affected, I would recommend starting off with a topical treatment. I will send the drops to your pharmacy. You will put on drop on the affected nail, daily."
1672,373,1403,"Good afternoon, ma'am."
1673,373,1404,"Have you ever had surgery, ma'am?"
1674,373,1405,Do you remember how old you were when you had surgery?
1675,374,1406,Do you have any allergies?
1676,374,1407,Okay.
1677,375,1407,What is your family medical history?
1678,375,1408,Do you know what type of skin cancer she has removed?
1679,376,1409,"Hello, miss. Today we're going to do a recheck for your hypertension. Sound good?"
1680,376,1410,I just want to check to see if you have any symptoms that can possibly raise alarm.
1681,376,1411,You are a seasoned veteran. Alright. So how is your chest? Any pains or tightness?
1682,376,1412,Is your heart beating alright? Do you feel like it is beating too fast or hard?
1683,376,1413,You are correct. You shouldn't notice it. How is sleeping?
1684,376,1414,Great. Any shortness of breath that causes you to wake up?
1685,376,1415,Are your legs doing well? Any swelling?
1686,377,1416,"Hello, it's nice to meet you."
1687,377,1417,My name is Doctor X and I will be taking care of you today.
1688,377,1418,I've been told that you'd like a refill on your Xanax prescription and something to help you break your smoking habit.
1689,377,1419,"Yes, I've heard of Chantix. We can look into it and see what's best fit."
1690,377,1420,How long have you been taking it?
1691,377,1421,"I see here that you also have mesothelioma in the lining of your stomach, is that correct?"
1692,377,1422,Are you currently experiencing any pain?
1693,377,1423,Do you take anything for the pain?
1694,377,1424,When were you diagnosed with mesothelioma?
1695,378,1425,Are you allergic to anything?
1696,378,1425,Like any medications?
1697,378,1426,Perfect!
1698,379,1427,Welcome to the clinic.
1699,379,1428,It is nice to meet you to. I hear an accent. Where are you from?
1700,379,1429,Wow! Your English is excellent now.
1701,379,1430,How old are you?
1702,379,1431,Happy birthday!
1703,379,1432,"So, your primary care physician sent you here for possible hydrocephalus."
1704,379,1433,Yes.
1705,379,1434,Can you tell me about the symptoms that you have been having.
1706,379,1435,How do you know that you have been walking funny?
1707,379,1436,"What do you notice about the way your wife's walk that has changed?
Guest_family: She walks wider then she used to, and I noticed that she stooped over. She walks much slower than she did before. She is often losing her balance. I have noticed her touching the walls and furniture to stabilize herself."
1708,379,1436,"Okay. Have you noticed her stabilizing herself all of a sudden? 
Guest_family: No. It has been happening more and more over the last six months or so."
1709,379,1436,"What else have you noticed about the way she walks? 
Guest_family: I noticed that she is having trouble stepping up onto things like a scale. She seems very unbalanced. She also seems to take her time as she walks. She can't be hurried."
1710,379,1436,That is good that you are taking your time. Do you use any devices to assist you to get around? Like a cane or a walker?
1711,379,1438,What happened that you had to go to the emergency room?
1712,379,1439,When did this fall happen?
1713,379,1440,I can see why that would make you nervous. Have you had any headaches?
1714,379,1441,Aren't you lucky.
1715,379,1442,Have you had any problems with your memory or cognitive abilities?
1716,379,1443,"What is your perspective on her memory and her cognitive abilities? 
Guest_family: I have noticed some changes. She will occasionally start a sentence and then not know what words to use to finish the sentence."
1717,379,1443,"Has she ever had trouble finishing a sentence the in the past? 
Guest_family: No, she has always been very well spoken never has lost thoughts."
1718,379,1443,Have you had any fainting or vertigo episodes?
1719,379,1444,Have you had and problems with your bowel movements?

1721,379,1446,Okey. Let us do some an exam.
1722,380,1447,"I mean, I am so happy to see your report today, your blood pressure looks much better. That's amazing given your past few visits your B P was out of control and even with changing your medications we were having tough time bringing it down."
1723,380,1448,Refractory hypertension.
1724,380,1449,But the good news is that it is getting better.
1725,380,1450,"Last time we talked about seeing the internal medicine doctor there at your senior center, right?"
1726,380,1451,"Hm, okay we need to reschedule that."
1727,380,1452,"Okay, your reports look fine. G F R is below sixty percent, that's a good sign.  Overall, Miss K, you look better, but we need to reschedule your appointment with the Internist. That's kind of important."
1728,380,1453,You are welcome.
1729,381,1453,Did you ever visit any hospital for any kind of surgery?
1730,382,1454,Hi there! How are doing today?
1731,382,1455,How have you been doing with keeping your hemoglobin levels between four and five point six prercent?
1732,383,1456,"So, are you married, ma'am?"
1733,383,1457,"I'm sorry to hear that, do you have any children?"
1734,383,1458,Do you live with either of them?
1735,383,1459,Do you smoke or drink?
1736,384,1460,"Good afternoon, so, who is the patient today? 
Guest_family: Good afternoon, doctor. My granddaughter is your patient today."
1737,384,1460,"What seems to be the problem today, young lady?"
1738,384,1461,Does it feel like pressure?
1739,384,1462,What other symptoms have you had?
1740,384,1463,"Interesting, anything else?"
1741,384,1464,Is it itchy?
1742,384,1465,"I see, are you going to school?"
1743,384,1466,"Okay, and have you been wheezing lately?"
1744,384,1467,"I see you have asthma, have you had any medication for this?"
1745,385,1468,Did you have any surgeries in the past?
1746,385,1469,Okay anything else?
1747,385,1470,Okay.
1748,386,1470,"Good afternoon, young man."
1749,386,1471,"How old are you, young man?"
1750,386,1472,"Thank you, so, what happened?"
1751,386,1473,"You need to be more careful, young man. What kind of symptoms do you feel in that finger?"
1752,387,1474,Hello. How are you feeling today?
1753,387,1475,I see. Did you smoke at the party?
1754,387,1476,Great. Where on your body does it hurt?
1755,387,1477,I see. Did you drink alcohol last night?
1756,388,1479,"Um, I have taken the plaster off and your foot looks good. I don't want you to restrict your activities, but you are the best judge of the situation. So, I will advise you to take it slow and do as much as you can tolerate."
1757,388,1480,"As long as you are doing fine, having no pain, I think we are okay."
1758,388,1481,Bye.
1759,389,1481,What is your family medical history?
1760,389,1482,How old was he when he was diagnosed?
1761,389,1483,"Any family history of uterine, ovarian or colon cancer?"

1763,390,1485,So you live with her?
1764,391,1487,I am here to help. Tell me what's going on.
1765,391,1488,How old are you ma'am?
1766,391,1489,Did you ever try to hurt yourself?
1767,391,1490,How long have you had these symptoms?
1768,391,1491,Do you work?
1769,391,1492,How are you doing at work with your mood swings?
1770,391,1493,Have you ever been on any kind of medicine or treatment before?
1771,391,1494,Do you know what you were diagnosed with?
1772,391,1495,"Let me check and enter it in the medical record for future references. According to this, they prescribed Wellbutrin for obsessive compulsive type disorder and yes it was related to your overeating. Did it help you?"
1773,391,1496,Have you ever been on antidepressants?
1774,391,1497,Any hot flashes or night sweat? Did you ever find yourself waking up to wet bed due to sweating?
1775,391,1498,"Just putting together all that you have told me here. You have mood swings; you find yourself in tears without any specific reason, you are not suicidal, never been on any kind of antidepressants. Am I missing something here?"
1776,391,1499,"Okay, I understand. Anything else that I should be aware of?"
1777,391,1500,Any surgeries in the past?
1778,391,1501,Oh! When was this?

1780,392,1503,Anything else?
1781,393,1504,"Good morning, ma'am, welcome in. I believe this is our first time meeting."
1782,393,1505,"Great, how old are you?"
1783,393,1506,"Thank you, what seems to be the problem today?"
1784,393,1507,"Like what, ma'am?"
1785,393,1508,"I see, do you have any food allergies?"
1786,394,1509,What's your family history?
1787,394,1510,I'm so sorry to hear that. I offer you my sincerest condolences.
1788,394,1511,"Does anyone else in your family suffer from leukemia, cardiac problems, or alcohol abuse?"

1795,395,1517,"Oh, how long have you had this problem?"
1796,395,1518,"Hm, I see, does it hurt you to pass stool? Did you notice any blood?"
1797,395,1519,"Oh, that's great. You are doing the right thing. In addition to that I will prescribe you some strong laxative you can drink that in morning it should help."
1798,395,1520,Any complains of heart burn or acidity or stomach pain?
1799,395,1521,"Yeah, you can get that kind of pain with constipation. Any cough or cold like symptoms? Any cough with sputum?"
1800,395,1522,"Okay, basically I don't think you have any stomach ulcer or anything, but we need to treat your constipation because I know it can be really uncomfortable."
1801,396,1522,"Do you take Diovan, estradiol, Norvasc, Wellbutrin?"
1802,396,1523,Okay so inhaler SR?
1803,396,1524,Do you take oxygen therapy at home?
1804,396,1525,Okay.
1805,397,1525,"Good afternoon, ma'am."
1806,397,1526,How long have you and your husband been married?
1807,397,1527,I assume you live together?
1808,397,1528,What do you do for a living?
1809,397,1529,That's wonderful. Do you drink or smoke?
1810,397,1530,Good for you.
1811,398,1530,"It looks like she had an appendectomy along with a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo oophorectomy sometime ago. 
Guest_clinician: Okay, noted."
1812,398,1530,Oh and it looks like she had a right hip fracture back in O five after a fall.
1813,399,1530,"Before we begin today, sir, I just need a few pieces of background information. I see here on my chart that you're thirty years old, is that correct?"
1814,399,1531,"Okay, and which hand is your dominant hand?"
1815,399,1532,"Now, take me through the timeline of your symptoms, please. When did everything start?"
1816,399,1533,What were your initial symptoms?
1817,399,1534,"Okay, when these symptoms began, how did you manage them?"
1818,399,1535,"Once you noticed the atrophy and contractures, that's the tightness you were experiencing, how were you treated?"
1819,399,1536,"Okay, do you have the report of that C T Scan with you today?"
1820,399,1537,"Thank you, okay, this shows an intramedullary lesion at C two three, and an extramedullary lesion at C six seven."
1821,399,1538,Yes sir. Did you have neck surgery?
1822,399,1539,"Okay, just so you know, you had a C six T one laminectomy, and they decompressed the spinal cord. How did you respond to this surgery?"
1823,399,1540,"Once your symptoms worsened, what happened?"
1824,399,1541,"Did you have any weakness, sir?"
1825,399,1542,Was one side worse than the other?
1826,399,1543,"In addition to the burning and weakness, did you have any other symptoms?"
1827,399,1544,"After all these symptoms began, how were you treated?"
1828,399,1545,"Thank you, this shows diffuse enlargement of the cervical and thoracic spine and multiple enhancing nodules in the posterior fossa."
1829,399,1546,"Well, that's more tumors in the spine. Did you have another surgery for this?"
1830,399,1547,"Okay, so you had a suboccipital craniotomy with tumor excision, decompression, and biopsy. The biopsy showed hemangioblastoma."
1831,399,1548,"Well no, not exactly, it's a benign tumor. After this surgery how were your symptoms?"
1832,399,1549,How have your symptoms progressed since?
1833,399,1550,How much weakness was there?
1834,399,1551,Can you go up and down stairs?
1835,399,1552,"How about going to the bathroom, is everything normal there?"
1836,399,1553,"Good, and what did the doctor at that clinic recommend?"
1837,400,1554,Any other allergies besides Penicillin?
1838,400,1555,I see here that you've previously tolerated Cephalosporins without any problems. Do you remember when you were last prescribed a Penicillin like antibiotic?
1839,401,1555,Where are you having pain?
1840,401,1556,Did the pain come on gradually?
1841,401,1557,Did you injure any other parts of your body?
1842,401,1558,How long ago did this happen?
1843,401,1559,"I see. Have you taken anything for it, such as Advil or Tylenol?"
1844,402,1560,Do you drink?
1845,402,1561,How about smoke?
1846,402,1562,How long have you been smoking?
1847,402,1563,Have you tried to quit or reduce how much you smoke?
1848,402,1564,I see. I'd recommend you consider nicotine patches because smoking brings with it many health problems.
1849,402,1565,I understand. How about any other drug use?
1850,402,1566,Okay. I'd rather you smoke weed than cigs. How many packs a year do you think you smoke on average?
1851,403,1567,How about any surgeries?
1852,403,1568,Are you sure?
1853,404,1569,Welcome to the clinic.
1854,404,1570,It looks like you were referred to us by Doctor Jones.
1855,404,1571,Great! The chart notes that Doctor Jones sent over says you are currently twenty weeks pregnant. Is that correct?
1856,404,1572,Do you have any other children?
1857,404,1573,Have you ever had any pregnancies? Including miscarriages or abortions.
1858,404,1574,I am so sorry to hear that.
1859,405,1575,Are you married?
1860,405,1576,Who do you have in your family?
1861,405,1577,Are you working?
1862,405,1578,What does that mean?
1863,405,1579,Sounds great. Do you smoke or drink?
1864,405,1580,I am guessing no drugs either?
1865,406,1581,When did you stop smoking?
1866,406,1582,Okay. How about any alcohol or drugs?
1867,406,1583,"Yes, please tell me son.
Guest_family: She used to drink a long time back and used to take a lot of prescription medication."
1868,406,1584,Thank you for that information. How long ago?
1869,407,1585,"Have you ever had surgery, ma'am?"
1870,407,1586,Not even a C section when you had your son?

1881,408,1597,How is the color of your urine? Is it dark or cloudy?
1882,408,1598,Any pain while urinating or burning sensation?

1903,411,1618,"Great, what seems to be the problem today, sir?"
1904,411,1619,"What makes you think this, sir?"
1905,411,1620,"Is there anything else of note, sir?"
1906,411,1621,What was this quiz like?
1907,411,1622,Are you having difficulty maintaining an erection until completion?
1908,411,1623,"Okay, do you have any significant medical conditions in the past that you have been treated for?"
1909,411,1624,What about testicular infections?
1910,411,1625,Have you had any traumatic injuries to the groin?
1911,411,1626,What about hernias? You can get them from playing sports or lifting weights. Have you ever had one of these?
1912,412,1627,"We were not able to find the cause of your pain right now, but in the future, we will do a few more tests and then we can have a diagnosis."
1913,412,1628,"Yes, I will write a prescription. It will help you both with your pain and nausea."
1914,413,1628,You had a bad acidity problem?
1915,413,1629,What came out in the vomit?
1916,413,1630,"But nothing anymore, right?"

1920,414,1634,Have you lost weight as a result?
1921,414,1635,"Wow, that's concerning. Are you experiencing any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain?"
1922,414,1636,"How about chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, or heart racing?"
1923,414,1637,"Any neurological symptoms, such as numbness or tingling?"
1924,414,1638,We'll get to the bottom of this. I'm waiting for your lab report to come back and then we can figure out the next steps.
1925,415,1638,I see here that you have no surgical history. Is this correct?
1926,416,1639,"So, sir, tell me about your knees, how long have they been bothering you?"
1927,416,1640,What kind of symptoms do you notice in these knees?

1934,418,1647,"As far as you know, is there any family history of cancer?"
1935,418,1648,"What about heart disease, does that sound familiar?"
1936,418,1649,"Good to know, what about the lungs, any history there?"
1937,418,1650,Do you know of anyone with dementia or Alzheimer's?
1938,418,1651,"I'm sorry to hear that, that's a hard disease to see your family go through. What about diabetes, does anyone have that?"
1939,419,1652,"Can you give me a quick run down of her medical history? 
Guest_family: Sure. It's a bit long, sadly."
1940,419,1652,"I'm sorry to hear that. 
Guest_family: She was recently diagnosed with dementia. She's also suffered from high blood pressure for some time now."
1941,419,1652,"When was she diagnosed with dementia? 
Guest_family: Six months ago."
1942,419,1652,"Any history of heart disease, diabetes, or stroke? 
Guest_family: No, but she's not able to control her bladder well which leads to her having frequent accidents. Oh and she's had back pain for several years along with degenerative changes to her spine. Poor thing. I can't help but feel so bad for her situation. It definitely hasn't been easy."
1943,420,1652,"Hi, there. How are you both doing? What brings you two to the Emergency Department?
Guest_family: Hi, Doctor. We're both doing fine. I brought my daughter in today because she's been feeling sick."
1944,420,1652,"I see. Let me ask your daughter a few questions before we start. Hi, ma'am. I understand you feel sick. Before we begin I just want to confirm some information with you. Where is your primary residency?"
1945,420,1653,Thank you. One last question. Do you smoke?
1946,421,1654,"Are you married, sir?"
1947,421,1655,That's very nice. Did you speak with the nurse before I came in here?
1948,421,1656,"We take good care of them. They'll be happy to hear that. Let me look, she should have left me some notes, um, yep, these look good, I agree with all of this. This looks good."
1949,422,1657,"Hi. How are you doing, sir?"
1950,422,1658,The nurse told me that you are on disability from work now. What happened?
1951,422,1659,What did you do for work? How long ago was your injury?
1952,422,1660,Which condition led to the disability?
1953,422,1661,Okay. Do you live alone or with family?
1954,422,1662,Are you a smoke or have you ever been?
1955,422,1663,How long ago did you quit?
1956,422,1664,How many years did you smoke? And how much did you smoke?
1957,422,1665,That's great. Any use of alcohol or illicit drugs?
1958,422,1666,What do you do for fun? Do you have any hobbies?
1959,422,1667,Okay.
1960,423,1667,How're you doing today?
1961,423,1668,Any plans for the weekend?
1962,423,1669,Gotcha. That's still nice. We used to have a golden when I was a kid. They're the sweetest dogs.
1963,423,1670,"Okay, so you're in for a follow up for your neck and back pain."
1964,423,1671,Have you been going to pain management?
1965,423,1672,How's your pain now?
1966,423,1673,Is the pain still keeping you up at night?
1967,423,1674,"Good, great to hear."
1968,424,1674,Let's see. Are you taking any medications?
1969,425,1675,Do you smoke cigarettes?
1970,425,1676,How much do you smoke per day?
1971,425,1677,Do you drink alcohol?
1972,425,1678,What is your family medical history?
1973,425,1679,I am so sorry for your loss.
1974,425,1680,What about your mother or siblings? Do they have any health conditions?
1975,426,1681,"So, ma'am, what do you do for a living?"
1976,426,1682,Congratulations on your retirement. Where did you go to college?
1977,426,1683,That's understandable. Do you have children?
1978,426,1684,"Fantastic, do they live at home?"
1979,426,1685,Do you drink or smoke?
1980,426,1686,What about harder substances?
1981,427,1687,You are five feet four inches.
1982,427,1688,Weight one ninety seven.
1983,427,1689,Your blood pressure is one twenty five over seventy five.
1984,428,1690,Do you smoke or drink?
1985,429,1691,"How's he feeling today? 
Guest_family: I think this is the worst he's been feeling all week."
1986,429,1691,"I'm sorry to hear that he hasn't been feeling well. What symptoms has he been having? 
Guest_family: He's been very congested as of late and seems to be coughing a lot more than usual. He was also running a fever yesterday."
1987,429,1691,"I see. What was his temperature? 
Guest_family: The thermometer was reading one hundred and one degrees Fahrenheit. Does he need to go to the hospital?"
1988,429,1691,"Let me evaluate and see what we can do for him today. 
Guest_family: Thank you, doctor."
1989,429,1691,"I suspect that he has an upper respiratory infection, possible pertussis. Is he still experiencing apnea?"
1990,430,1691,"Okay, let me quickly examine him. Mom do you give the permission? I will quickly check his genitalia. Can you pull his pants down?
Guest_family: Sure, you can check."
1991,430,1691,"Well, everything looks fine, his penis and testes are normal shape and size for his age. No fluid accumulation or swelling in the scrotum area, no evidence of herniation there."
1992,431,1691,We can release you from the hospital today if we have a safe place for you to go. Is there a parent or guardian we can release you to?
1993,431,1692,"In that case, we will have to keep you in the hospital until your foster mom returns from her trip."
1994,431,1693,Yes. I think we can make some arrangements to make that happen.
1995,432,1693,Do you know about any medical issues running in your family?
1996,433,1694,Do you have any past or present medical conditions?
1997,434,1695,"Do you have any family history of lung disease, thromboembolism, pulmonary embolism, stroke, or heart disease."
1998,434,1696,How many children do you have?
1999,434,1697,Do your children have any health condition?
2000,435,1698,Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
2001,436,1699,Do you know of any medical problems that run in your family?
2002,436,1700,"Oh wow, I understand. It can be hard for many people to share intimate details about their health to others, even when it comes to disclosing medical info to their own children. For now, I'll put unknown but please let me know if anything changes."
2003,436,1701,Of course. It's not totally uncommon for people to not know their family history.
2004,437,1701,"Hello again, how are you doing, miss?"
2005,437,1702,"All good here too. I know you are an established patient of dermatology here and was last seen in our office on July thirteenth, two thousand and four.  I will be asking you a few questions just to check whether the entry in our record is updated or not."
2006,437,1702,How old are you now?
2007,437,1703,Where are you from originally?
2008,437,1704,I am seeing you today as a referral from A B C for reevaluation.
2009,437,1705,"So, let's see what you have been treated with. Your record here says with Aristocort cream, Cetaphil cream, increased moisturizing cream and lotion. Does this sound right to you?"
2010,437,1706,Are you washing your hands in Cetaphil cleansing lotion?
2011,437,1707,What brings you here today?
2012,437,1708,Are you married?
2013,437,1709,Are you working somewhere?
2014,438,1710,"You have been diagnosed with allergic rhinitis, right? For how many years?"
2015,438,1711,"Yeah, it's hard to control. Are you diabetic?"
2016,438,1712,So no hypertension or any kidney diseases?
2017,438,1713,"Every been diagnosed with tuberculosis, asthma, or lung disease?"
2018,439,1714,Hm how would you describe her diet?
2019,439,1714,"Does she eat solid food?  
Guest_family: Mostly thin liquids and ground meat."
2020,439,1714,I see.
2021,440,1714,"Hello there, I am Doctor Nathan."
2022,440,1715,How old are you?
2023,440,1716,Do you get regular periods?
2024,440,1717,Any hot flashes?
2025,440,1718,Any other symptoms?
2026,440,1719,Based on all the symptoms my assessment would be mood swings along with postsurgical menopause. That would be the cause for your hot flashes.
2027,441,1719,Any change in appetite?
2028,441,1720,Any stomach pain or change in bowel movement?
2029,441,1721,Any history of bowel issues?
2030,441,1722,Any hernia problem?
2031,441,1723,Any history of stomach ulcer?
2032,441,1724,Did you notice any rectal bleeding?
2033,441,1725,Any liver issues or jaundice?
2034,441,1726,Okay.
2035,442,1726,Do you drink alcohol?
2036,442,1727,Okay and how bout cigarettes? Do you smoke or vape?
2037,442,1728,"And no drugs and stuff, right? No snorting, I V or anything right?"
2038,442,1729,That's a good thing.
2039,443,1730,"Let me check your neck, it looks nice and symmetrical. Your thyroid looks normal it is not enlarged."
2040,443,1730,Does it hurt you when I press on your neck?
2041,443,1731,Neck is nontender.
2042,443,1731,"Okay, I don't see any bulging of external jugular vein."
2043,443,1732,"Oh, I am talking about the vein in your neck, it shows no bulging. No abnormal masses present. Can you turn your head from left to right and right to left, any pain in your neck or difficulty turning?"
2044,443,1733,Can you rotate your head clockwise and anti clockwise.
2045,443,1734,Any pain?
2046,443,1735,"Okay, let me just make a note here full range of motion with no pain."
2047,444,1735,"Hello, miss. It looks like you are here for your yearly physical. How is everything going?"
2048,444,1736,Great to hear. Has there been any changes in drinking and smoking?
2049,444,1737,"Great. Looks like drinking and smoking is off the menu. In regard to the mammogram, do you make sure to do self breast examinations? I believe I showed you how to do this last time."
2050,444,1738,I highly suggest you start doing so. Sometimes people do not get mammograms for a few years and it is important to make sure nothing is growing.
2051,445,1739,Hello. How are you doing today?
2052,445,1740,Have you ever had a surgery.
2053,445,1741,"Looks like you had eye surgery, cataract surgery, and lumbar decompression, correct?"
2054,445,1742,I need to see what the problem is first.
2055,446,1742,"Hi you guys, how are you?"
2056,446,1743,"I am fine, thank you. So, she gets seizures? 
Guest_family: Yes."
2057,446,1743,"And when did it start? 
Guest_family: She was fourteen or thirteen. I think fourteen."
2058,446,1744,"Fourteen, okay. Are you taking anything for it?
Guest_family: Yeah, she is on medication."
2059,446,1744,"Anybody else in the family have a similar problem? 
Guest_family: No, but her sixteen year old brother suffers from N S V T and he sees a specialist."
2060,446,1744,"Okay, any other siblings or family members with medical conditions? 
Guest_family: Other kids in the family are doing fine, but her maternal grandma suffers from high blood pressure and diabetes."
2061,446,1744,"Okay. Sorry but I must ask this, any recent death in the family in past one year child or adult? 
Guest_family: Thankfully no!"
2062,447,1744,Do you have any known allergies to medications?
2063,448,1745,Did you have your vaccines?
2064,448,1746,Did you skip any?
2065,449,1747,"Hi, how can I help you, ma'am?"
2066,449,1748,Okay but tell me what is going on and we can figure this out.
2067,449,1749,Do you have urine bag?
2068,449,1750,"Yes, it looks like five hundred M L came out. So possible urinary obstruction. Also, they started you on steroids and colchicine. How are you feeling now?"
2069,449,1751,Okay that is good. Any fever and chills?
2070,449,1752,Any problem with urination like pain or frequency or blood in urine?
2071,449,1753,"Okay I will evaluate that. How about any cough, blood in sputum?"
2072,449,1754,"Any chest pain, or difficulty breathing?"
2073,449,1755,Okay that sounds good.
2074,450,1755,Does low blood pressure run in your family?
2075,450,1756,Okay.
2076,451,1756,Were you ever diagnosed with any kind of cancer in the past?
2077,451,1757,Did you ever had any rashes? Was there any change in your moles?
2078,451,1758,Any sudden weight loss history?
2079,451,1759,How about your energy level how do you feel?
2080,452,1760,What medications are you currently taking?
2081,452,1761,How much Insulin do you take?
2082,453,1762,Anything else that is going on?
2083,453,1763,Okay.
2084,453,1764,"Okay no fever, nausea, anything of that sort?"

2086,454,1766,Are you right or left handed?
2087,454,1767,When were you first diagnosed with Parkinson's?
2088,454,1768,Do you remember who diagnosed you?
2089,454,1769,Did you lose consciousness during any of your falls?
2090,454,1770,I'm sure that was difficult to experience.
2091,454,1771,"By slower, do you mean the movements of your arms and legs were slower and impaired?"
2092,454,1772,Did you notice any improvement while taking it?
2093,454,1773,Noting that it's February thirteenth nineteen ninety six.
2094,454,1774,"Are you experiencing any other symptoms, such as stroke like events, vision changes, seizures, or problems with moving and coordinating your arms?"
2095,454,1775,"Any headache, nausea, vomiting, chills, or fever?"
2096,455,1776,"Hi there! How are the both of you doing today? 
Guest_family: I am doing well but my son is sick.  He is two and a half years old."
2097,455,1776,"What are his symptoms?
Guest_family: He has a bad cough. He's been sick for the last three or four days. It sounds like there is phlegm rattling around in there when he coughs. He had a bad coughing fit this morning. I got nervous and decided to bring him in."
2098,455,1776,"During his coughing episode this morning, did you notice any loss of breath or gasping for air? 
Guest_family: No."
2099,455,1776,"Has he had a runny nose?

2105,457,1778,So just to double check. No past medical history?
2106,458,1779,"Do you drink or smoke, ma'am?"
2107,458,1780,"Good, what about harder drugs?"

2112,461,1785,Can you think of something this is related to?
2113,461,1786,Do you get belly pain?
2114,462,1787,"Good morning, ma'am. Can you confirm your age for me?"
2115,462,1788,"Thank you, so, how is your knee doing today? Hope the osteoarthritis is getting better."
2116,462,1789,Have you had any improvement with the rest and antiinflammatories we've talked about before?
2117,462,1790,"I see, you'd be a good candidate for a knee replacement."
2118,462,1791,"Historically, it's less than one percent, we use prophylactic antibiotics to control for infection the entire time."
2119,462,1792,"Yes, you won't feel a thing."
2120,463,1792,How old are you?
2121,463,1793,What brings you in today?
2122,464,1794,Any medical issues running in your family?
2123,464,1795,You know anyone in your family or relatives who ever had diseases like diabetes or any heart issues?
2124,465,1796,"Hello, miss. Could you verify your age, please?"
2125,465,1797,Great. What is the reason for your visit today?
2126,465,1798,I see. What kind of problems are you experiencing?
2127,465,1799,"Thank you. Let me take a look. Looks like you have some general allergies and food allergies, loss of taste, problems with your G I tract, asthma, G E R D, and dry mouth or xerostomia."
2128,465,1800,"Oh, I see. I would describe that as environmental inhalant allergies."
2129,466,1800,Are you a smoker?
2130,466,1801,Do you use alcohol or any recreational drugs?
2131,466,1802,Any current use of drugs or alcohol?
2132,466,1803,Okay.
2133,467,1803,Do you take any-
2134,467,1804,Yes.
2135,467,1805,"Oh, do you mean Proventil?"
2136,467,1806,Is it up to date?
2137,467,1807,Good. I always like to advise my patients to check expiration dates.
2138,468,1807,Welcome into the office.
2139,468,1808,Let us start with your family medical history.
2140,468,1809,Okay. That is alright.
2141,469,1809,"So, you are here to review your sleep study results, right?"
2142,469,1810,First let's go back to your medical history a little bit and then we will continue with the result.
2143,469,1811,"So, you first came to our Pulmonary Clinic, and you were suffering with dyspnea even on minimal exertion. At that time, we evaluated you and we realized that there was some evidence of irregular sleep and daytime fatigue. At that time you also complained of nighttime choking episodes which got less intense over the past many months."
2144,469,1812,"Sure. But first tell me, how is your sleeping routine like?"
2145,469,1813,Are you able to sleep as soon as you go to bed?
2146,469,1814,How would you compare your sleep here in the lab and at your home?
2147,469,1815,How do you feel when you wake up in the morning?
2148,469,1816,Do you snore?
2149,469,1817,Did you ever feel that you have difficulty breathing while you are asleep?
2150,469,1818,"You said you used to, so it is not anymore?"
2151,469,1819,How's your daily routine? Do you nap in the daytime?
2152,469,1820,Do you smoke?
2153,469,1821,Have you noticed any change in your weight?
2154,469,1822,If that was your maximum how is your weight now?
2155,469,1823,"So, for your health care, you are coming here in the outpatient psychiatry and also going to your maintenance clinic, right?"
2156,469,1824,"Your current medications include Methadone, Trazodone, and Seroquel."
2157,470,1825,"So, I see you were diagnosed with an acid reflux problem and high blood pressure twenty years back?"
2158,470,1826,And then you also have arthritis and Parkinson's.
2159,470,1827,"Also, you had a brain stroke?"
2160,470,1828,"Ah, yes. We also call it as T I A."
2161,470,1829,And currently are you on any medications?
2162,470,1830,"Yeah, atrial fibrillation."
2163,471,1831,"Good morning, ma'am."
2164,471,1832,How are you feeling today?
2165,471,1833,"That's good to hear, ma'am."
2166,472,1833,"According to the patient, his symptoms started getting progressively worse over the past two days. 
Guest_clinician: Does he have a history of cellulitis?"
2167,472,1833,No.
2168,473,1833,Welcome to the clinic.
2169,473,1834,Are you from the area?
2170,473,1835,Tell me about you family medical history.
2171,473,1836,That is a lot. What is your medical history involving your parents?
2172,473,1837,"Did you have any problems in school such as learning disabilities, attentional problems, difficulty learning to read, failed grades, special help in school or behavioral problems?"
2173,473,1838,Are you married?
2174,473,1839,I am so sorry.
2175,473,1840,Are you working in health care with your nursing degree?
2176,473,1841,What do you do in your spare time now?
2177,474,1842,"Good afternoon, young man."
2178,474,1843,"How old are you, sir?"
2179,474,1844,"So, what brings you in today?
Guest_family: Well, at first, we went to Sierra Pacific Orthopedic Group, and he had an M R I that showed, um, O C D in the left knee."
2180,474,1844,"Yes, I see that from the report. 
Guest_family: So, we're here for a second opinion on that."
2181,474,1844,"Yes, we should do surgery on this knee. There's gross instability of the fragment, and we don't want that get worse. 
Guest_family: Okay, that's about what we've heard so far. What are the risks of infection of the procedure?"
2182,474,1844,"It's less than one percent. We use antibiotics to control for infection. Other risks include bleeding, changes in sensation of the limb, changes in motion, failure to relieve pain or restore the articular cartilage, the possible need for another procedure, and possible early arthritis. I would not worry, though. These things are rare.
Guest_family: Okay, will he be asleep the entire time?"
2183,474,1844,"Yes, he won't feel a thing. 
Guest_family: Okay, my husband agrees. We want to do the surgery."
2184,475,1844,"Good afternoon, young lady."
2185,475,1845,"Let's get the personal questions out of the way to begin, shall we?"
2186,475,1846,Have you had any S T D s recently?
2187,475,1847,Are you sexually active?
2188,475,1848,"I'm looking here, and your last P P D was negative, but we'll do another one today."
2189,475,1849,Have you been compliant with all of the medicine you've been prescribed?
2190,475,1850,"Good, do you remember when your last dentist appointment was?"
2191,475,1851,What did they do for you at your last visit?
2192,475,1852,"Good, and when was your last pap smear?"
2193,475,1853,I assume it was negative?
2194,475,1854,Have you had a mammogram yet?
2195,475,1855,Do you have a family history of breast cancer?
2196,476,1856,"Hi, I would like to physically examine your rectal area, ok?"
2197,477,1857,"Hello, what brings you here today?"
2198,477,1858,How old are you?
2199,477,1859,I know I'm in the wrong profession. I have to do that every time I meet someone. So how old are you?
2200,477,1860,Are you right handed or left handed?
2201,477,1861,"So, you said that your legs suddenly gave out. What happened exactly? Was it sudden? Or were you noticing some weakness before as well?"
2202,477,1862,"So, is your weakness like overall in your legs or it is at any single point?"
2203,477,1863,"Is there any change in your sensations? Like if I touch you, is it like same before or was there any change?"
2204,477,1864,Is there change in vision? Are you seeing double?
2205,477,1865,Any difficulty in swallowing or eating? Any loss of consciousness?
2206,477,1866,"Any difficulty in speech? Slurring, or anything like that?"
2207,477,1867,"You said that these episodes have been happening for some time, so did you see anyone for those before?"
2208,478,1868,Any medical traits in the family?
2209,478,1869,Anything else?
2210,479,1870,"Are you married, ma'am?"
2211,479,1871,Do you live alone?
2212,479,1872,Do you drink or smoke?
2213,479,1873,What about more illicit substances?
2214,480,1874,"What is your family medical history, sir?"
2215,480,1875,I am so sorry.
2216,480,1876,How old was she when she passed?
2217,480,1877,Your family had been through a lot of loss.
2218,480,1878,Do you have any siblings that are still living?
2219,480,1879,Do you have kids?
2220,480,1880,Do you know of anyone else in the family with neurological disorders?
2221,481,1881,Do you have any known allergies?
2222,481,1882,Any allergies to any drug?
2223,482,1883,Are you married?
2224,482,1884,Is the baby your first kid?
2225,483,1885,"Welcome to A B C D General Hospital. Before we get started, ma'am, how old are you?"
2226,483,1886,"Great, and what seems to be the problem today?"
2227,483,1887,Is the pain getting worse?
2228,483,1888,How have you managed this bunion so far?
2229,483,1889,I see.
2230,484,1890,How old are you?
2231,484,1891,"So, you are here for the dietary consultation. Is this your first pregnancy?"
2232,484,1892,Were you taking any insulin at that time?
2233,484,1893,Sure.
2234,484,1894,"Sure, I will explain everything to you. We also have a pamphlet to explain it. Here have a look. You can take it with you."
2235,484,1895,Are you exercising?
2236,484,1896,How long is the walk to school?
2237,484,1897,Do you drink milk?
2238,485,1898,Do you know of any family history of kyphosis?
2239,485,1899,It has to do with rounding of the spine. Does anyone in your family have a rounded posture?
2240,486,1900,When did you retire from your job?
2241,486,1901,"Aw, how many grandkids do you have? And do you live alone?"
2242,486,1902,That's so wonderful to hear.
2243,487,1902,"Good afternoon, young lady."
2244,487,1903,"How has your weight been since your last visit, with the phentermine?"
2245,487,1904,"Well, it could be worse, but we're at a plateau, I'd like to see you lose some more per month."
2246,487,1905,What has been your lowest weight?
2247,487,1906,"Well, if this plateau continues, we should discontinue the phentermine."
2248,487,1907,"It shouldn't be used to maintain your weight, but only to get the weight down. So, if it's not serving that purpose, we shouldn't use it. There's no real benefit there."
2249,488,1908,Anyone in the family had a stroke?
2250,488,1909,How about someone in the family with heart disease?
2251,488,1910,Okay.
2252,489,1911,"Wow, I cannot tell, you speak English so well, no German accent."
2253,489,1912,Okay and did you move with your family?
2254,489,1915,Your Mesothelioma?
2255,489,1916,"Okay, and who all are there in your family?"
2256,489,1918,Okay.
2257,489,1918,And do you drink or smoke?
2258,489,1919,Any funny drugs like heroine or coke?
2259,489,1920,Okay.
2260,490,1920,What brings you in today? Can you also please state your age?
2261,490,1921,"On a scale of one to ten, how bad is the pain at its worst?"
2262,490,1922,How would you rate it now?
2263,490,1923,Have you been taking your diabetes medication?
2264,490,1924,Yes.
2265,490,1925,"Great. Okay, let's try to get to the bottom of this stomach pain."
2266,491,1925,Your cholesterol appears to be elevated today. Is this the first time you've been told that your cholesterol levels are high?
2267,491,1926,I see here that you have diabetes and high blood pressure.
2268,491,1927,Does diabetes or high blood pressure run-
2269,492,1928,How was the sleep study?
2270,492,1929,I can imagine. That's always tough. It looks like the eval of your daytime fatigue and insomnia was sent over. Let me print out a copy and we can go over it together. How old are you again?
2271,493,1930,So what brings you in today?
2272,493,1931,I'm guessing you're not feeling too great.
2273,493,1932,When was the last time you took your temperature?
2274,493,1933,I see. Did the nurse take your temperature when you came in?
2275,493,1934,"Have you been experiencing cold like symptoms, such as cough, nasal congestion, headache, or nausea?"
2276,493,1935,Have you tried taking any medicine to help with the fever?
2277,493,1936,Have you had recent sick contacts?
2278,494,1937,Anything that has been going on?
2279,494,1938,I mean anything wrong from head to toe that you would like to add?
2280,494,1939,Okay. Good.
2281,495,1939,How was the procedure?
2282,495,1940,"I do, actually. It's a pretty common procedure. I'm glad to hear that you didn't experience any complications."
2283,496,1941,Hello and welcome to our dermatology office. What is the reason for your visit?
2284,496,1942,Let me take a look. Do you have prior reports about your history?
2285,496,1943,Let me go get it really quick. I'm reading the report and it looks like your family is positive for atopy.
2286,496,1944,I see. Do you know if you have psoriasis?
2287,496,1945,It's a skin disease that usually has scaly patches.
2288,496,1946,"Great. Before I prescribe you medicine to treat your eczema, are you allergic to any drugs?"
2289,497,1947,Do you drink?
2290,497,1948,How much coffee do you consume each day?
2291,497,1949,Any history of sexually transmitted disease?
2292,497,1950,How're your eating habits?
2293,497,1951,Do you exercise?
2294,498,1952,Good afternoon Sir. Do you know how you got here?
2295,498,1953,Do you have any recollection of the incidences leading up to your loss of consciousness?
2296,498,1954,Prior to the episode did you experience any chest pain or shortness of breath?
2297,498,1955,Any feelings of abnormal heart rhythm?
2298,498,1956,Do you have any history of any cardiac problems?
2299,498,1957,How are you feeling now?
2300,498,1958,Do you know how old you are?
2301,499,1959,Hello Miss Lee how are you?
2302,499,1960,"Yeah, I know it's been a longstanding pain in both your arms."
2303,499,1961,Can you pinpoint where exactly is the pain?
2304,499,1962,Okay so mostly in the medial part. Tell me do you feel any weakness?
2305,499,1963,Are you left handed?
2306,499,1964,"Hm, any neck pain?"
2307,499,1965,Can you please tell me your age again?
2308,499,1966,Did you ever have these kind of signs and symptoms in the past?
2309,499,1967,Okay and are you taking anything for pain?
2310,499,1968,Lyrica okay and is it helping?
2311,499,1969,Any problem in walking or change in how you walk?
2312,499,1970,And you are having regular bowel movements any changes?
2313,499,1971,"How about urine, any burning or difficulty peeing?"
2314,499,1972,"Okay good. So, the neurological exam we did earlier, I have the results for it."
2315,499,1973,"Well, you were tested positive for Phalen's test on your left hand."
2316,499,1974,"It means that you have something called Carpal tunnel syndrome, which explains your numbness and tingling sensation in your left hand. It also explains your pain in the middle part of your hand as it's caused due to pinching or compression of a nerve called median nerve."
2317,499,1975,"Well, it's possible that your repetitive hand motion could have caused it or sometimes it's just the anatomy of your wrist."
2318,499,1976,Yeah.
2319,499,1977,"No, rest of your neurological exam was normal."
2320,499,1978,Don't worry we are here.
2321,500,1979,Have we gone over your survey results from your last visit?
2322,500,1980,"Yes, I do, they show that you have anxiety disorder."
2323,501,1981,I see here that you've been having some chest pain. Where along the chest?
2324,501,1982,When did it start?
2325,501,1983,How'd you describe the pain?
2326,501,1984,"Any other symptoms with the pain, such as shortness of breath?"
2327,501,1985,How long does the pain usually last?
2328,501,1986,Have you taken anything for the pain?
2329,501,1987,Have you had similar pain in the past?
2330,501,1988,"And you had surgery on your abdomen five days ago, correct?"
2331,501,1989,I'd like to run some tests and get you in for a CAT scan to see what's going on.
2332,502,1989,"It looks like he has a history of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and Afib. 
Guest_clinician: Does he see a cardiologist for his Afib?"
2333,502,1989,"Not according to his chart. I'll see if I can call his emergency contact to confirm.
Guest_clinician: Okay. Keep me posted."
2334,503,1989,Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
2335,503,1990,How about drugs?
2336,503,1991,Who do you live with?
2337,504,1992,How old are you now?
2338,504,1993,Oh wow! That is so nice. Happy belated birthday.
2339,504,1994,It looks like you are here today for a recheck for the prostatitis.
2340,504,1995,I see you have been followed by Doctor Mathis.
2341,504,1996,How often do you see him?
2342,504,1997,Excellent. And the last time I saw you was in May two thousand and four.
2343,504,1998,"Yeah, it has. Okay. You are here to discuss some libido problems?"
2344,504,1999,How long have you been having these difficulties?
2345,504,2000,That is a common side effect that some men experience from Proscar. Have you tried any medication to help bring back your libido?
2346,504,2001,Does it help at all?
2347,504,2002,How many times a night do you get up to relive yourself now?
2348,504,2003,"Okay, so still often."
2349,504,2004,That is good news.
2350,505,2004,"Are you married, sir?"
2351,505,2005,
2352,505,2005,Is this your only marriage?
2353,505,2006,"If you don't mind my asking, how long was your longest marriage?"
2354,505,2007,"Do you have any children, sir?"
2355,505,2008,"How old are they, sir?"
2356,505,2009,"Okay, thank you. Did you go to college, sir?"
2357,505,2010,How long were you in the military?
2358,505,2011,Where are you working currently.
2359,506,2012,"So, looks like you have stones in your C B D. I am not hundred percent sure but most likely its stones."
2360,506,2013,"Yeah, short for common bile duct. It's a small tube like structure which connects your liver duct and gallbladder."
2361,506,2014,"Yeah, and because of that you have inflammation in your gallbladder."
2362,507,2015,"No, this is his first one. 
Guest_clinician: Okay, got it."
2363,508,2015,"Can you tell me more about your son, please? 
Guest_family: Sure, he's ten years old now."
2364,508,2015,"How long has he used his walker?
Guest_family: Well, he's been using that since he started walking."
2365,508,2015,"How old was he when he started walking?
Guest_family: He was about a year old."
2366,508,2015,"Good, what seems to be the problem today?
Guest_family: He keeps complaining about the back of his legs being tight."
2367,508,2015,"Can you sit on the table, young man? Yes, I'm bending his legs, we call this the popliteal angle, and both sides flex to only about twenty. 
Guest_family: Where should that be normally?"
2368,508,2015,"He should be able to get to ninety. 
Guest_family: What can we do about this?"
2369,508,2015,"I think we should do surgery on this leg. How does he walk? Can I see?  
Guest_family: Well, just look at him."
2370,508,2015,"Yes, he does not walk with a crouched pattern, but he is toe walking. 
Guest_family: Can we correct that instead of the hamstring tightness?"
2371,508,2015,"Well, I believe he should have surgery on the hamstring, as well. 
Guest_family: Okay, right now we want to do surgery to fix his walking. What are the risks of infection?"
2372,508,2015,"They're low, historically, they're less than one percent. The risks include anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and the motion of walking, and it may also not always cure the toe walking. There is also possible stiffness after wearing the cast and other cast issues. 
Guest_family: Okay, and will be under anesthesia during this? Is this worth it?"
2373,508,2015,"Absolutely, he won't feel a thing. It is worth it because the chances of the risks happening are low. 
Guest_family: Yes, we'd like to do the procedure. Let me text my husband really quick. Okay, yes, my husband agrees."
2374,509,2015,Did you ever have any reaction to any medication given? Any known allergies?
2375,509,2016,Was there any swelling where your lymphnodes are?
2376,509,2017,Was there ever any complaint of abnormal lymph nodes?
2377,510,2018,Do you have anyone with psychiatric symptoms in the family?
2378,510,2019,What do you mean?
2379,510,2020,Adopted?
2380,510,2021,Wow that must have been tough.
2381,511,2022,"Do you have any chronic conditions I should know about, sir?"
2382,511,2023,"What about injuries, have you ever broken a bone?"
2383,512,2024,Welcome to the clinic.
2384,512,2025,Do you have any family history of cancer? Either solid tumors or blood malignancies?
2385,513,2026,Can you tell me what surgeries have you had in the past?
2386,513,2027,Okay. I want to know how many pregnancies you had and how many babies?
2387,513,2028,Okay. Do you have any issues with your periods?
2388,513,2029,Oh. When was your last menstrual period?
2389,513,2030,Okay. Good.
2390,514,2030,"Hello, sir. Before we begin your visit, could you verify your age and ethnicity for me, please?"
2391,514,2031,Thank you. What brought you in today?
2392,514,2032,I see. What seems to be happening?
2393,514,2033,What part of your leg?
2394,514,2034,I see. So just the leg?
2395,514,2035,Was that severe?
2396,514,2036,I can see you still have an external fixation on your knee so that the fracture heals. Did the hospital give you a report on the surgery?
2397,514,2037,"Thank you. Let me take a look. So, it looks like you underwent grafting and full thickness skin grafting for closure for a large defect in your left posterior thigh. That seems to be healed in the gluteal fold on the left area."
2398,514,2038,Let me examine the area.
2399,514,2039,I can see several areas that have hypergranulation tissues around the graft site and low in the leg.
2400,514,2040,I don't think so. Are you feeling any symptoms of a fever or anything?
2401,514,2041,That's good. You don't have any infections then.
2402,515,2041,And are you working?
2403,515,2042,Okay good.
2404,515,2042,Do you smoke?
2405,515,2043,Hm and how much do you smoke?
2406,515,2044,"And how about alcohol, do you drink?"
2407,515,2045,Any drugs?
2408,515,2046,Yeah.
2409,516,2047,"Welcome to the clinic, ma'am. I am Doctor Smith."
2410,516,2048,"Doctor X referred you to us, is that correct?"
2411,516,2049,It looks like you have a birthday coming up. Happy early birthday!
2412,516,2050,Doctor Kim's notes said that you have had pain in the left flank pain. Can you tell me more about the pain?
2413,516,2051,Okay. Have you had any nausea or vomiting?
2414,516,2052,"Have you noticed any blood, pain and or burning during urination?"
2415,516,2053,Any fever or chills?
2416,516,2054,I have the ultrasound results that Doctor X ordered the other day.  The ultrasound found a stone in your left ureteral. The stone is about one point three C M in size.
2417,516,2055,Yes. Let us go over the treatment options.
2418,517,2055,"Good afternoon, ma'am. You're forty one years old, correct?"
2419,517,2056,"Thank you, have you followed up with Doctor X since your surgery?"
2420,517,2057,"Oh, just because she referred you to me."
2421,517,2058,That's fine. Have you heard the details behind your surgery?
2422,517,2059,"Well, you had a complicated case, but we did an anterior cervical discectomy, two level corpectomy, with a spinal decompression and fusion with fibular strut and machine allograft in your large cervical plate."
2423,517,2060,"Yes, how are you doing today?"
2424,517,2061,Have you been able to move your arms and legs for the last few days?
2425,517,2062,"Good, are you having any issues breathing?"
2426,517,2063,"Okay, today, I think you'd be a good candidate for a halo vest placement."
2427,517,2064,"Okay, we can do it here."
2428,517,2065,"Let me get A B C to help me with this. Also, we're going to move you to S I C U room one."
2429,517,2066,"Well, this is a P M T halo, I like this one better than the Bremer halo vest, and I'll use morphine and Versed."
2430,517,2067,"Yes, I have local anesthetic, it's xylocaine and epinephrine, um, it's somewhere between fifteen and twenty C C."
2431,518,2067,"Is everything fine?
Guest_family: My mom is not well."
2432,518,2067,"When did this start?
Guest_family: I don't know but she is not in her correct state of mind."
2433,518,2067,"Okay let's see what we can do, how old is she?
Guest_family: She is around seventy four years old."
2434,518,2067,"Okay. Don't worry, we will see what we can do.
Guest_family: Thanks!"
2435,518,2067,Of Course.
2436,519,2067,"Welcome in, sir."
2437,519,2068,Let us start off with a little background.
2438,519,2069,What is your current living status? Do you live with others or on your own?
2439,519,2070,Are you looking for a place in Sacaton?
2440,519,2071,Back in Coolidge? Have you lived there before?
2441,519,2072,I am so sorry to hear that.
2442,519,2073,Your sister is very generous. Are you and your sister close?
2443,519,2074,That's wonderful. Are you a tobacco user?
2444,519,2075,How much do you smoke per day?
2445,519,2076,Do you or have you ever used drugs or alcohol?
2446,519,2077,That's great. Do you attend A A meetings?
2447,519,2078,I think it could be beneficial to you.
2448,519,2079,I have a list for different support groups in the area that I can give you.
2449,520,2080,"How are you feeling after that insulin drip, Miss A B C?"
2450,520,2081,"Yes, between one hundred fifteen and one thirty four. So, on the second day after your admission they did laparoscopic removal of your gallstones. You were very difficult to intubate. But everything went well with surgery. There was some swelling and adhesions around your gallbladder, but all is well that ends well."
2451,520,2082,Great question. After surgery they were around two thirty three.
2452,520,2083,"Yes, sliding scale insulin."
2453,520,2084,"Yes, you are all set to go home, everything is stable."
2454,521,2084,"Good morning, ma'am."
2455,521,2085,"Welcome to A B C D General Hospital. My nurse says that you are forty one years old, and you identify as a White female, is that correct?"
2456,521,2086,"Thank you, so, what seems to be the trouble today?"
2457,521,2087,Is your pain right here?
2458,521,2088,"Okay, this is known as your navicular bone. What makes the pain worse?"
2459,521,2089,Do you have any past history of problems with this foot?
2460,521,2090,Do they know what caused these?
2461,521,2091,Have they done surgery on these in the past?
2462,521,2092,Have you ever had this problem in your feet or spine?
2463,522,2093,On April twenty two four we went over your list of medication and allergies.
2464,522,2094,Let me check something.
2465,523,2095,How's the low fat and low cholesterol diet going? Have you been finding it manageable?
2466,524,2096,"Hello. Before we begin your visit, could I ask a few questions to fill in some missing information?"
2467,524,2097,Does your family have any health related problems?
2468,524,2098,"So, would you say alcoholism runs in your family?"
2469,525,2099,Are you working these days?
2470,525,2100,Congratulations. I hope you're enjoying your time off.
2471,525,2101,You mentioned having a smoking history. When did you quit and approximately how much did you smoke?
2472,525,2102,Did you smoke only cigarettes?
2473,525,2103,How about alcohol?
2474,525,2104,Great.
2475,526,2104,"Good morning, sir, welcome to A B C D General Hospital."
2476,526,2105,"We'll do our best. Um, before we begin, I just need some background information. So, how old are you?"
2477,526,2106,"Good, and what race do you identify with?"
2478,526,2107,"Thank you, so, what seems to be the problem today?"
2479,526,2108,I see it. How long has this tissue mass been there on that foot?
2480,526,2109,Do you have any history of cancer?
2481,526,2110,I see.
2482,527,2111,What do you do for a living?
2483,527,2112,"Wow, that's a lot. Congratulations on your retirement!"
2484,527,2113,"Wonderful, do you have any children?"
2485,527,2114,"Fantastic, do you drink or smoke?"
2486,527,2115,How many drinks would you say you have a week?
2487,527,2116,"Okay, and is there any history of drug or illicit substance abuse, sir?"
2488,528,2117,As per your chart I am going to put some of the following things in your diagnosis.
2489,528,2118,Yes I can see that in your chart over here.
2490,528,2119,We now have added hyperglycemia and obstructive sleep apnea.
2491,529,2119,Do you smoke?
2492,530,2120,Do you have any orthopedic conditions that run in your family that I should know about?
2493,530,2121,"Yeah, does anything like that sound familiar?"
2494,532,2133,Any sugar or B P problem?
2495,532,2134,"Okay, how about thyroid or any other hormone related problem?"
2496,532,2135,Cholesterol?
2497,533,2136,"Refractory anemia.  
Guest_clinician: Gotcha."
2498,534,2136,"Do you have patient's family history? 
Guest_clinician: At this point of time, we don't have it."
2499,534,2136,"Hm, okay."
2500,535,2136,"Hello, miss. How can I help you today? The nurse said the matter was urgent."
2501,535,2137,Can you describe what type of dizzy spells you are having? What do they feel like?
2502,535,2138,Are you feeling okay right now or are you experiencing symptoms?
2503,535,2139,Let me take a look at the rash on your legs. Are the bruises new?
2504,535,2140,In the past couple days have you had a fever or chills?
2505,535,2141,What about chest pains?
2506,535,2142,Does the dizziness make you nauseous?
2507,535,2143,What about diarrhea?
2508,535,2144,Are there any parts of your body that are hurting?
2509,535,2145,Have you measured your blood sugar at all? I ask because the notes state there is a history of gestational diabetes and when blood sugars are out of the normal limits this can cause some of the symptoms you are having.
2510,536,2146,Does anyone in your family have or have history of any colon cancer or unusual polyps?
2511,536,2147,Any other family history?
2512,537,2148,Any known medical history in the family?
2513,537,2149,How about anyone with high blood pressure or heart disease or diabetes in the family?
2514,538,2150,How are you feeling today?
2515,538,2151,"According to your chart, you have seen with us for three separate self harm attempts. Have you had any other self harm events that you have not come to see use for?"
2516,538,2152,I also see that this is your third time in the last two months that you have attempted to harm yourself. Is there anything that is currently going on in your life that could be triggering these resent episode?
2517,538,2153,I am so sorry. That is a lot to deal with.
2518,538,2154,Have you been diagnosed with any mental health conditions?
2519,538,2155,Have you ever been put on any medication for the for your depression?
2520,538,2156,How long ago did you take the Lexapro?
2521,538,2157,Okay.
2522,539,2157,Do you have any drug allergies?
2523,540,2158,"So, if you see here Doctor Patrick there are multiple areas with hypergranulation tissue on the left leg posteriorly and I get a sense that it's associated with the trauma to the back of his right leg. 
Guest_clinician: Yeah, I agree."
2524,541,2158,How're you today?
2525,541,2159,Oh no. How long has this been going on?
2526,541,2160,Are you experiencing any allergies alongside your asthma?
2527,541,2161,Do you take anything for your allergies?
2528,541,2162,Did the Flonase or Advair help at all?
2529,541,2163,How so?
2530,541,2164,I'm sorry to hear that.
2531,541,2165,Do you notice these symptoms are still there after you finish your cycle?
2532,541,2166,Are your cycles generally regular?
2533,541,2167,Do you get any night sweats or hot flashes while you're on your period?
2534,541,2168,Have you had any other medical troubles recently?
2535,541,2169,Do you remember how many times you noticed blood in your urine?
2536,541,2170,"Have you had any other urinary symptoms since? How about bdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or anything of the like?"
2537,541,2171,Have you gotten your urine rechecked recently?
2538,541,2172,I can write an order for you if you'd like or you can make an appointment with your urologist. Do you have a specific urologist that you see?
2539,541,2173,"Yes, in fact I'd like to order some blood work while you're here."
2540,541,2174,Do you know what they checked?
2541,541,2175,Do you happen to have a copy on hand or could you fax me the resulxts?
2542,541,2176,That would be great. Thank you. Let me write down our fax number for you.
2543,542,2176,"Okay, so your psych evaluation came out unremarkable. Do you have any other problems?"
2544,543,2177,"Hello there, how are you?
Guest_family: I am little scared."
2545,543,2177,"I understand, so how old is she? 
Guest_family: She is ten days old today."
2546,543,2177,"And just wanted to confirm the ethnicity is Caucasian, right?
Guest_family: Yes."
2547,543,2177,"Okay, so tell me what's going on with her?
Guest_family: I was feeding her and then I suddenly noticed this unusual jerky movement in both her arms and legs. 
Guest_family: It lasted about a minute."
2548,543,2177,"When did you first notice it? 
Guest_family: The first day when I was feeding her, she was barely a day old."
2549,543,2177,"Okay, and how many times till now?
Guest_family: About six times."
2550,543,2177,"Did you notice any interrupted breathing or bluish color around her mouth? 
Guest_family: No."
2551,543,2177,"While the episode occurs do you notice any color changes in the baby? 
Guest_family: No."
2552,543,2177,"Did you happened to notice any arching of the back or eyes rolling back?
Guest_family: No, it usually happens while she is sleeping, so I didn't notice her eye movements. But I am able to wake her up and stop the hand and leg movements."
2553,543,2177,"Okay. Otherwise, is she feeding well and is active? 
Guest_family: Yes, absolutely! Although she falls asleep a lot during breast feeding but other than that everything is fine."
2554,543,2177,"And how often are you feeding her and for how long? 
Guest_family: I breast feed her every two to three hours for about fifteen to twenty minutes."
2555,543,2177,"Okay, and how many dirty diapers? 
Guest_family: Well, her pee diapers have increased to up to eight and I would say about six to seven poopy diapers a day."
2556,543,2177,"And did you notice the color of her poop? 
Guest_family: Yeah, it's like dirty yellowish color."
2557,543,2177,Okay.
2558,544,2177,Has anyone in your family had heart diseases?
2559,544,2178,Is he alright now?
2560,544,2180,What exactly was the heart disease named? Do you know?
2561,544,2181,How old is he now?
2562,544,2182,Okay. Do you smoke or drink alcohol? And how much?
2563,545,2183,Are you on steroids?
2564,545,2184,"Any history of cancer, chemotherapy or anything related?"
2565,546,2185,"How have you both been doing? 
Guest_family: We are good."
2566,546,2185,"I see she has been gaining weight since she has been home. Have you been following the meal plan that we discussed? 
Guest_family: Yes. It has been helping."
2567,546,2185,Great!
2568,547,2185,"We don't have any record of P M H for this patient.
Guest_clinician: Okay."
2569,548,2185,"Oh, dear God! What happened? 
Guest_family: Hi Doctor, I am his mom."
2570,548,2185,"Hello, so what happened?
Guest_family: He was trying to climb a tree, slipped from there and got a deep cut on his thigh."
2571,548,2185,"So, you fell from the tree?"
2572,549,2186,What is up with your teeth man? It's been giving you problems huh?
2573,549,2187,"Oh, so this is new?"
2574,549,2188,Then why didn't you go and visit your regular dentist?
2575,549,2189,Oh I am sorry.
2576,549,2190,Okay any other problems or any other complaints?
2577,549,2191,How about any recent illnesses or injuries?
2578,549,2192,Do you have any medicine at home for pain?
2579,549,2193,Okay I understand. How old are you again?
2580,550,2194,How's your jaw doing?
2581,550,2195,Do you mind if I take a look?
2582,550,2196,"It's hard to say, but I'm thinking it could be T M J. I'd like to get you in to see a T M J specialist."
2583,551,2196,Are you taking Citalopram for depression?
2584,551,2198,Is that so?
2585,551,2199,What do you take for pain?
2586,552,2200,What is your family health history?
2587,553,2201,Can you tell me about your family?

2594,555,2208,What work do you do?
2595,555,2209,Do you have kids?
2596,555,2210,Do you smoke cigarettes?
2597,555,2211,How much and what kind?
2598,555,2212,Okay. How about alcohol or drugs like substance abuse?
2599,555,2213,How long have you smoked?
2600,556,2214,Hello! How are you doing?
2601,556,2216,Has it been a month already?
2602,557,2217,Do you have any allergies?
2603,557,2218,Are you sure?
2604,558,2219,"Just to debrief, we will rule out angina related heart problems while evaluating your jaw pain."
2605,558,2220,Yes they might be.
2606,558,2221,Pardon?
2607,558,2222,"We have discussed this before, but keep track of your high cholesterol and hypothyroid."
2608,559,2222,"Hello, sir. How are you feeling today?"
2609,559,2223,"Oh, wow. I can see the rashes all over your arms. Are there rashes anywhere else?"
2610,559,2224,I see it on your torso. When did this all start?
2611,559,2225,I'm going to take a look at the rashes and the rest of your body.
2612,559,2226,It looks like your face and lips are not swollen. Could you say ah for me?
2613,559,2227,It looks like your tongue isn't swollen either.
2614,559,2228,"Have you been feeling a shortness of breath, wheezing, or other related symptoms?"
2615,559,2229,Sounds good. I wonder why this happened. Did you do anything the night before?
2616,559,2230,I see. Do you remember being itchy after that? Did you try any new foods?
2617,559,2231,Are you taking any new medications?
2618,559,2232,You don't recall being exposed to any other substances?
2619,560,2233,Do you have any family medical history of migraines?
2620,560,2234,Okay.
2621,561,2234,What do you do for work?
2622,561,2235,Are you a smoker?
2623,561,2236,How much do you smoke per day?
2624,561,2237,How long have you been a smoker.
2625,562,2238,Are you allergic to anything?
2626,562,2239,Are you sure? Penicillin or sulfa?
2627,562,2240,That's good.
2628,563,2240,"Hi there, sir! How are you doing today?"
2629,563,2241,Have you been using any substances?
2630,563,2242,"Okay. Any shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain or back pain?"
2631,563,2243,"Are you having any headaches, hallucinations or visual disturbances?"
2632,563,2244,Do you have any open sores or wounds?
2633,564,2245,Have you had any surgical procedures done?
2634,564,2246,Got it.
2635,565,2247,"Oh okay, are your still working?"
2636,565,2248,Hm. And you smoke cigarettes?
2637,565,2249,How about alcohol?
2638,566,2250,"How old are you, sir?"
2639,566,2251,Are you right handed or left handed?
2640,566,2252,When was your last stroke?
2641,566,2253,Did they put you on some medications?
2642,566,2254,Are you taking them regularly?
2643,566,2255,"Do you feel anything else along with these episodes like a urine urgency, tendency to bite your tongue, headaches, any visual change, or your heart is beating very fast? Any kind of weakness or numbness or shortness of breath?"
2644,566,2256,How frequent are these episodes?
2645,567,2257,Any medical disorders in the family?
2646,567,2258,Do you know the name of the tumor?
2647,568,2259,Do you have any major medical conditions that I should know about?
2648,568,2260,"Thank you, so I see congestive heart failure, chronic renal insufficiency, azotemia, hyperglycemia, coronary artery disease, and a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Oh, and azotemia."
2649,568,2261,Are you taking any medications?
2650,568,2262,"I see, what about any neurological or psychological conditions?"
2651,568,2263,"I see here that you also have perioperative anemia, does that sound familiar?"
2652,568,2264,Do you have any other symptoms you'd like to report today?
2653,569,2265,"Doctor Shami, can you please take down the notes as I examine the patient? 
Guest_clinician: Sure."
2654,569,2265,"Can you put the heading as cervical lymph nodes. 
Guest_clinician: Okay."
2655,569,2265,I am going to check for any swelling in your neck okay? Can you look down?
2656,569,2266,"Alright, I do not feel anything here. Can you look up?"
2657,569,2267,"No palpable nodes here. None of the lymph nodes are enlarged or have any swellings. 
Guest_clinician: So, no lymph adenopathy?"
2658,569,2267,Yeah.
2659,570,2267,You have chronic pain?
2660,570,2268,You use tobacco also?
2661,570,2269,"And you have a history of hepatitis C, right?"
2662,570,2270,Okay.
2663,571,2271,Have you had any surgeries in the past?
2664,572,2272,"Do you live close to the office, or did you have to drive a long way here?"
2665,572,2273,"Good, are you working right now?"
2666,572,2274,"That's good, sometimes it's nice to stay busy. Is there any history of drug or alcohol abuse I should know about?"
2667,573,2275,"How are you, Mary?"
2668,573,2276,"Oh, is it like the one you got last time?"
2669,573,2277,"Oh, I remember that one. It took almost three treatment cycles to get resolved."
2670,573,2278,"Yeah, it looks like you have residual spina bifida."
2671,573,2279,"I think, that is the reason you developed this pressure ulcer. It appears to be on the right trochanter area. In simple terms you have developed a pressure sore on the outer part of your hip."
2672,573,2280,"Oh, I am sorry dear. So, how long since you have had this ulcer?"
2673,573,2281,"Yeah, good thing you came. We need to treat it. Did you experience any chills or fever?"
2674,573,2282,Any other symptoms?
2675,574,2283,Do you have any history of heart disease that you know of?
2676,574,2284,How about diabetes?
2677,574,2285,"Good, and how about your lungs? Do they work well."
2678,575,2286,How about allergies to medications?
2679,576,2287,Your chest x ray showed diffuse pulmonary edema. This means that you have fluid in your lungs. That would explain your chest pain and the difficulies with your breathing. I would like to start you off with a course of antibiotics to prevent any possible infection. I will also send in a prescription for Furosemide. It will reduce the fluid accumulation in your lungs. Do you have any questions?
2680,576,2288,You should start to feel better within three to five days.
2681,577,2288,Any headaches?
2682,577,2289,Any history of seizures or epilepsy?
2683,577,2290,Any sudden loss of consciousness or have you blacked out?
2684,577,2291,Any weakness? Feeling any tremors in your body?
2685,577,2292,Any history of stroke or any brain related condition?
2686,578,2293,Are there any known disease running in your family?
2687,578,2294,What about your mom? How old is she?
2688,579,2295,Are you currently living alone?
2689,579,2296,What do you do for a living?
2690,579,2297,Nice. Where do you work?
2691,579,2298,"Do you drink, smoke, or do injection drugs?"
2692,579,2299,Any recent travel?
2693,579,2300,That sounds nice. How was your trip?
2694,579,2301,Great to hear. I have a few more questions I need to ask so bear with me. How is your sexual history? Are you sexually active?
2695,579,2302,Did you use protection?
2696,579,2303,Have you been tested for S T D's?
2697,579,2304,Have you ever been incarcerated?
2698,579,2305,One last question. Have you ever been in need of a blood transfusion?
2699,580,2306,"Good afternoon, champ, how you holding up?"
2700,580,2307,"Oh no, before we begin, how old are you, sir and which hand do you write with?"
2701,580,2308,"Great, so tell me, how long have you had this lower back pain?"
2702,580,2309,Have your symptoms improved at all since they began?
2703,580,2310,Does the pain radiate into your legs?
2704,580,2311,Do you remember the initial date of the beginning of your low back pain?
2705,580,2312,Have you seen another doctor for this pain?
2706,580,2313,What kind of treatments did he recommend?
2707,580,2314,Did you drive yourself?
2708,580,2315,How did the antiinflammatories work?
2709,580,2316,Was there any leg numbness?
2710,580,2317,Have you seen an orthopedist for this pain?
2711,580,2318,What kind of imaging studies did that orthopedist do?
2712,581,2319,Alright. So this is going to be a complex case. Your wound is complicated by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus cellulitis.
2713,581,2320,"There is. It will be more aggressive, but we can do it."
2714,582,2320,"What is going on with him?
Guest_family: He is complaining of chest pain."
2715,583,2320,"Good morning, young man. You're a patient of Doctor X Y Z, correct?"
2716,583,2321,"I just need to confirm some demographic information before we get started today. So, you're a twenty nine year old white male, correct?"
2717,583,2322,"Great, thank you. So, what seems to be the problem today?"
2718,583,2323,Do you have a lot of swelling?
2719,583,2324,Have you every been stung by wasps before?
2720,583,2325,Have you had similar reactions before?
2721,583,2326,"Okay, that's good. Do you have any shortness of breath or difficulty with your throat?"
2722,583,2327,Do you have any rapid heartbeat or anxiety?
2723,583,2328,"So, it's just the localized swelling where you got stung?"
2724,584,2329,When was your last menstrual period?
2725,584,2330,Okay so it says you have had an abortion recently?
2726,584,2331,Okay.
2727,584,2332,No I would have you see our Gynecology and Obstetrician.
2728,585,2333,"Oh, I am so sorry to hear that.
Guest_family: He has some fluid coming out of his belly button as well as his penis."
2729,585,2333,"Okay I will look at it. But other than that, everything else looks good? Any other problems related to circumcision?
Guest_family: No, no other issues."
2730,586,2333,"Welcome to the clinic, Miss A."
2731,586,2334,Let's start with your medical history. What medical conditions do you have?
2732,586,2335,What kind of cancer do you have?
2733,586,2336,Did they put you on an anticoagulant medication for the blood clotting?
2734,586,2337,Have you had any other surgeries?
2735,586,2338,How are you feeling today?
2736,586,2339,Have you been experiencing any daytime fatigue?
2737,586,2340,This could be due to your sleep apnea. Who is treating you for your sleep apnea?
2738,586,2341,Did Doctor X recommend a C P A P machine to use at night?
2739,586,2342,How much uninterrupted sleep do you think that you get per night?
2740,586,2343,That is not enough sleep. No wonder you are falling asleep at work. I recommend following up again with Doctor X regarding your sleep apnea. You are at a much higher risk for obesity and high cholesterol if you continue to not address the issues you have been having with the lack of sleep and sleep apnea.
2741,587,2344,They gave you Procrit for your anemia?
2742,587,2345,Okay. Are you married? Who do you live with?
2743,587,2346,"Okay, and do you smoke or drink alcohol?"
2744,587,2347,Great.
2745,588,2348,Hello. How are you doing?
2746,588,2349,Tell me how can I do that? What's bothering you?
2747,588,2350,"Hold on, hold on. First, tell me how old are you?"
2748,588,2351,"Okay, now tell me what are you afraid of?"
2749,588,2352,Do you work?
2750,588,2353,"Tell me about the eating habits. Do you prepare meals at home, or do you order from outside?"
2751,588,2354,"You said you don't try to eat, so are you facing any symptoms because of not eating?"
2752,588,2355,What is your sleeping pattern? How much are you sleeping throughout the day?
2753,588,2356,When do you test for ketones?
2754,589,2357,How old are you? What brings you here today?
2755,589,2358,Does changing positions helps you?
2756,589,2359,Is it only in your legs or it starts there and goes somewhere else as well?
2757,589,2360,When did you first notice it?
2758,589,2361,Have you ever noticed any night sweats?
2759,589,2362,Any other issue? Anything else going on? Your body temperature is a little on the higher end.
2760,589,2363,How are your sugar numbers?
2761,589,2364,That's good. How much is your fasting sugar?
2762,589,2365,Okay.
2763,589,2366,"Yeah, sure, that's a great idea. I should tell my assistant and they will call you for labs before your appointment for diabetes checkup."
2764,589,2366,Anything else going on? How is everything else?
2765,590,2367,Are you married?
2766,590,2368,Do you have kids?
2767,590,2369,Do you work?
2768,590,2370,Did you ever smoke?
2769,590,2371,What about alcohol or any other kind of drugs?
2770,591,2372,"Is patient allergic to any medication? 
Guest_clinician: Yes, actually he is allergic to quite a few medicines. I have noted them down, here is the list."
2771,591,2372,"Okay, so he is allergic to Lamisil, Equagesic. Oh, he is allergic to Bactrim too. 
Guest_clinician: Yeah, and Dilatrate and cyclobenzaprine."
2772,591,2372,"That's quite a lot, we need to be careful while making his treatment plan.
Guest_clinician: Yeah."
2773,592,2372,Hi there! I am Doctor Smith.
2774,592,2373,Let's start with your family medical history.
2775,592,2374,I am so sorry for your loss. How old was your mother when she passed?
2776,592,2375,How did your brother pass away?
2777,592,2376,You have had a lot of loss.
2778,592,2377,"I have a support group I can refer you to for people to have been through loss. Would you be interested a referral, sir?"
2779,593,2378,"I will ask some simple questions, okay?"
2780,593,2379,How old are you and how would you define yourself in terms of ethnicity?
2781,593,2380,Great. What brings you to the emergency room?
2782,593,2381,Okay.
2783,593,2382,Did you noticed any other symptoms other than weakness?
2784,593,2383,Did you have wet cough?
2785,593,2384,Any shortness of breath?
2786,593,2385,How about while sleeping or doing something else?
2787,593,2387,Which side left or right?
2788,593,2388,For how long?
2789,593,2389,Did you ever get any type of injury in the area?
2790,593,2390,What about your bowel movements?
2791,593,2391,Any change in urinary habits?
2792,593,2392,Any changes in your skin? Any rash? Any kind of eyesight issue?
2793,593,2393,What about pain? Like headache or any joint pain?
2794,594,2394,"Have you ever had surgery, ma'am?"
2795,594,2395,What year was that in?
2796,594,2396,"Great, thank you. What else have you had done?"
2797,594,2397,"Thank you, do you have any children?"
2798,594,2398,I'm so sorry to hear that. Did you have a C section with any of them?
2799,595,2399,Did you had any surgery in the past?
2800,596,2400,Any allergies?
2801,596,2401,Okay so molds reaction.
2802,597,2401,"Hi there, how are you dear?"
2803,597,2402,"Nice to meet you. So I see you have been referred by Doctor X.
Guest_family: Yes, she is our family doctor."
2804,597,2402,"Okay, so you noticed some behavioral problems with your daughter and reported to her, is that right?
Guest_family: Yes, I have been noticing them for a while. She loses her focus quickly. We also got a few complaints from school regarding her behavior. We also met a couple of other doctors but they diagnosed her with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder."
2805,597,2402,"Well, looking at her reports I am afraid it looks like she does have A D H D, but the good news is we can treat her, so don't worry.
Guest_family: Okay."
2806,597,2402,"I am going to prescribe her some medicines which will help her deal with this.
Guest_family: Thank you."
2807,597,2402,"So, I will write her a prescription for Adderall and Clonidine. They have some really good results in treating A D H D. Which pharmacy do you go to?
Guest_family: We go to Costco pharmacy by the X Y Z corner."
2808,597,2402,"Okay, I will send it there."
2809,597,2403,"Nice meeting you too, take care."
2810,598,2403,He had circumcision?
2811,598,2404,Do you remember the date?
2812,599,2405,"Good morning, sir. You're sixty one years old, correct?"
2813,599,2406,"Great, and you identify as Caucasian, right?"
2814,599,2407,"Thank you, do you have any medical conditions that I should know about?"
2815,599,2408,How are you handling your diabetes?
2816,599,2409,"Okay, thank you for telling me. What seems to be the problem today?"
2817,599,2410,Do you have any itchiness or pain?
2818,599,2411,Have you seen any other doctors about this?
2819,599,2412,Do you have any images from this visit?
2820,599,2413,"Okay, these show a foreign body in the foot."
2821,599,2414,"Well, that's consistent with cellulitis."
2822,599,2415,It's a skin infection we clean it up in surgery.
2823,599,2416,"We should do an irrigation debridement for the cellulitis, and remove the foreign body. I think that will really help."
2824,600,2417,"Hello, sir. How are you doing today?"
2825,600,2418,"Hello, ma'am. What seems to be the problem with your husband? 
Guest_family: He's been having some problems with his skin in his private region. He's too shy to talk about it himself."
2826,601,2418,"Are you married, ma'am?"
2827,601,2419,Does he help you out around the house?
2828,601,2420,"So, do you drink or smoke?"
2829,601,2421,"How about more illicit substances, do you use any of that?"
2830,602,2422,Anything else going on from head to toe?
2831,602,2423,Are you sure?
2832,603,2424,"He's doing much better. He'll be going home today with a prescription for Zithromax. 
Guest_family: I'm glad he's able go home and get some rest."
2833,603,2424,"However, I'd like to still see him in the office next week for a reevaluation.
Guest_family: Great. Can we make the appointment right now?"
2834,603,2424,"Yes, the front desk will be able to help you with that."
2835,604,2424,How long have you been running a fever?
2836,604,2425,Have you taken anything for the fever?
2837,604,2426,When was the last time you took your temperature?
2838,604,2427,"Are you experiencing any other symptoms, such as shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or others?"
2839,604,2428,It could be. We're still waiting on your urine results. Do you have a history of cataracts or glaucoma?
2840,604,2429,"Okay, great. Any signs of pneumonia or valley fever?"
2841,604,2430,What about blood in your vomit or feces?
2842,604,2431,Any neurological symptoms like T I A or C V A? That is slurred speech or stroke symptoms.
2843,604,2432,Great to here. With the pandemic I wanted to check on your mental health too. Any depression or anxiety?
2844,604,2433,Cool. Do you have any issues with blood disorders?
2845,605,2434,"Hello, miss. It looks like some information is missing for your profile. Is it fine if I ask you a few questions?"
2846,605,2435,Do you currently smoke?
2847,605,2436,Did you smoke before?
2848,605,2437,"Well, it's good to hear that you've stopped. I encourage you to continue to not smoke."
2849,605,2438,Last question. Do you drink alcohol?
2850,606,2439,"Hello, sir. So, remind me, how long ago was your procedure?"
2851,606,2440,"Okay, and just to refresh your memory, we did a percutaneous screw fixation of a Schatzker I V tibial plateau fracture, and we've managed those toe fractures nonoperatively."
2852,606,2441,You broke your second and fifth toes.
2853,606,2442,"Absolutely, if you look here, right here is where the breaks are. These are called the metatarsal heads."
2854,606,2443,"Yep, and where are you living now?"
2855,606,2444,That's really good. Are you in any pain today?
2856,606,2445,"Great, have you been going to P T?"
2857,606,2446,"Are there any signs of infection, like drainage from the incision?"
2858,606,2447,"Great, are you having any fever symptoms, like cough, runny nose, sore throat, fatigue, anything like that?"
2859,606,2448,"With your history of spinal stenosis, the broken toes, and the surgery, that's a pretty normal side effect."
2860,607,2448,Do you currently smoke? Or did you smoke in the past?
2861,607,2449,Great to hear. Are you working right now?
2862,607,2450,Does your job allow you to take time for yourself?
2863,608,2451,Hello. Are you ready for your surgery today?
2864,608,2452,It'll be fine. Don't worry too much about it. Have you ever had a surgery before?
2865,608,2453,"You have nothing to worry about. I've done this procedure multiple times, and everyone was fine after."
2866,609,2454,What is your family medical history?
2867,609,2455,Okay.
2868,609,2456,That is fortunate.
2869,610,2457,How's it going? I haven't seen you in a long time.
2870,610,2458,Remind me again. Does you family have a history of migraines.
2871,610,2459,Okay. Let's perform some tests.
2872,611,2459,"Hello, this is your follow up visit, right? Welcome back! Have you been taking your Plaquenil for lupus, ma'am?"
2873,611,2460,"Your prescription is two hundred M G twice a day, correct?"
2874,611,2461,Do you have your eye report with you today?
2875,611,2462,"Good, thank you, what seems to be the problem today?"
2876,611,2463,When did this pain start?
2877,611,2464,Is there any associated trauma? Did you fall?
2878,611,2465,"Are you having any fever or chills, or cold or flu like symptoms?"
2879,611,2466,How about swelling? Are any of your joints swollen?
2880,611,2467,"Okay, that's interesting."
2881,612,2467,"So, I know you're technically not allowed to drink, but I'm required to ask this anyway. Do you drink at all?"
2882,612,2468,When is that by the way?
2883,612,2469,"Wow, good luck. It'll be yet another big accomplishment."
2884,612,2470,And how about smoking of any kind?
2885,613,2471,Welcome in.
2886,613,2472,Let us start with your family medical history.
2887,613,2473,Who has diabetes?
2888,613,2474,I am so sorry. How did he pass away?
2889,613,2475,That is incredibly rare. Is your mother still with us?
2890,613,2476,Do you have any siblings?
2891,613,2477,"Do you know of any family members with neurological disorders such as M S, epilepsy, or Huntington's?"
2892,614,2478,"How're your other children doing? 
Guest_family: Not so wonderful. They're all on antibiotics."
2893,614,2478,"For the same? 
Guest_family: Yep. They all have ear infections and chest colds."
2894,614,2478,"Your hands are full then. 
Guest_family: Tell me about it, doctor. I can't seem to catch much of a break."
2895,614,2478,It's definitely been a tough winter for you and your family.
2896,615,2478,Do you use tobacco or other drugs?
2897,615,2479,Do you drink?
2898,616,2480,Is this your mother with you today?
2899,616,2481,"Great, welcome, what did you do this this ankle, young lady?"
2900,616,2482,Which ankle did you twist?
2901,616,2483,Where does it hurt the worst?
2902,616,2484,"Do you have a primary care physician?
Guest_family: Yeah, we go to Doctor Brown."
2903,616,2484,Do you have any other injuries to speak of?
2904,617,2485,"Good afternoon, young lady."
2905,617,2486,"What grade are you in, young lady?"
2906,617,2487,Do you play any sports?
2907,617,2488,"Good, are both of your parents at home?"
2908,617,2489,Do you have any siblings?
2909,617,2490,"Great, have you started your periods?"
2910,618,2491,"How many children do you have, ma'am?"
2911,618,2492,That's wonderful. Did you have any complications with the pregnancies?
2912,619,2494,"Tell me what brings you here, sir?"
2913,619,2495,How frequent is it?
2914,619,2496,What do you do when you have these cramps?
2915,619,2497,Did you ever have this symptom before?
2916,619,2498,Are you taking any medications?
2917,619,2499,Do you have any other medical condition?
2918,619,2500,Why did you stop the medications?
2919,619,2501,Do you know your C D four count?
2920,620,2502,"So, this is your follow up? How are you doing so far with Lamictal?"
2921,620,2503,What time of day was it? That you had these episodes.
2922,620,2504,"I have your recent E E G report. It did show multiple spikes and some complexes on both the sides, but it is more prominent on left."
2923,620,2505,Are you able to drive?
2924,620,2506,"Is there any change in your social history or any other symptoms that arise or, or is it same as before?"
2925,621,2507,What types of surgeries have you had in the past?
2926,621,2508,Okay.
2927,622,2508,Have you had any surgeries in the past?
2928,622,2509,"Oh, wow, do you remember it at all?"
2929,623,2510,Do you smoke cigarettes?
2930,623,2511,Do you drink alcohol or use any recreational drugs?
2931,623,2512,Okay.
2932,624,2512,Do you smoke or drink?
2933,624,2513,Any history of drug abuse?
2934,624,2514,Okay.
2935,625,2514,"Yes. I suspect they have possible C M V pneumonitis as well. 
Guest_clinician: Are they on immunosuppressants?"
2936,625,2514,"Yes. They have polymyositis and they're taking Prednisone and Methotrexate.  
Guest_clinician: Got it."
2937,626,2514,"Alright we already spoke about your past medical history, anything else you might want to add?
Guest_family: Oh, dad did you also talk about your depression?"
2938,626,2514,Depression? I don't think we spoke about that.
2939,626,2515,"Okay, let me make a note of it."
2940,627,2515,How are you?
2941,627,2516,What brings you here today?
2942,627,2517,Is it on both sides?
2943,628,2518,"Do you remember the details of your surgery, sir?"
2944,628,2519,We did a left inguinal hernia repair.
2945,628,2520,"You have a history of prostate cancer as well, correct?"
2946,628,2521,"Yes, that sounds familiar. What medicines are you taking right now?"
2947,629,2522,How many people do you have in your family?
2948,629,2523,"Wow, that's great!"
2949,629,2524,Okay. And do you have siblings?
2950,629,2525,Wow!
2951,629,2526,Hm okay.
2952,630,2526,You are referred for some abdominal infection right?
2953,630,2527,Yes that's what we will evaluate you for.
2954,631,2527,"Hi, how are you doing? How old are you?"
2955,631,2528,Good. How can I help?
2956,631,2529,"Oh, when did this happen, sir?"
2957,631,2530,"Okay, then what did you do?"
2958,631,2531,Okay let me see.
2959,631,2532,Okay. Can you tell me when the last time you had a tetanus shot?
2960,631,2533,Okay and are you allergic to anything?
2961,631,2534,"Oh, okay."
2962,631,2535,Oh! But you need it.
2963,631,2536,Okay. let me fine some alternative.
2964,632,2537,Have you had a recent vaccination?
2965,632,2538,Do you have any planned in the near future?
2966,632,2539,Great.
2967,633,2539,How old are you?
2968,633,2540,Are you right handed or left handed?
2969,633,2541,What exactly happened?
2970,633,2542,When did you see changes in your eyelid?
2971,633,2543,"Yeah, I have your brain C T report from there. There is no sign of any kind of bleeding, but I do see a torturous blood vessel there."
2972,634,2544,I see here that you're in for a med refill. Is that correct?
2973,634,2545,What are you taking it for? And how long have you been on it?
2974,634,2546,Who usually prescribes it to you?
2975,634,2547,Do you happen to have their name or contact info on hand?
2976,634,2548,How much Klonopin do you take for your panic attacks?
2977,634,2549,I can try to look it up online. When were you last prescribed Klonopin?
2978,634,2550,Let me pull up the page and see if we can figure out your dosage and when you're due for a refill based on your doctor's orders.
2979,634,2551,"Are you experiencing any symptoms currently, such as headache, nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath or chest pain?"
2980,635,2552,How are you? I haven't seen you in a long time.
2981,635,2553,How did that happen?
2982,635,2554,"Oh, no. So, you and your husband live together now?"
2983,636,2556,What kind of car were you driving that night?
2984,636,2557,I'm so sorry to hear that. I'm glad that you are here in one piece. Were you wearing your seatbelt?
2985,636,2558,Good.
2986,636,2559,That's such a shame. Do you remember how fast the car was going when it collided into you?
2987,636,2560,Did you lose consciousness at all?
2988,636,2561,Did you get out of the car by yourself?
2989,636,2562,"This was on January fifteenth, correct?"
2990,637,2563,How're you doing?
2991,637,2564,Hm let's see. I'd like to check your glucose and lipid panels and get you back in here again.
2992,637,2565,How long has that been going on?
2993,637,2566,"Are you having any other symptoms? Black or tarry stool? Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea? Lightheadedness?"
2994,637,2567,I'd like to order a hemoccult then. It's going to check to see if you're still having blood in your stool.
2995,637,2568,"Yes, they'll be able to help you and answer any additional questions you may have."
2996,637,2569,"Remember you need to fast for the lipid panel, so I'd recommend going in early tomorrow morning before eating breakfast."
2997,637,2570,"And before I send you on your way, have you been able to schedule your yearly mammogram?"
2998,638,2571,"Hello, ma'am. How are you doing?"
2999,638,2572,I'm sorry to hear that. Have you always had knee pain?
3000,638,2573,Are you able to do any activities still?
3001,638,2574,I see. We can offer to do arthroplasty to fix your knees.
3002,638,2575,It's like a reconstruction of your joints. It'll help increase your ability to do daily activities.
3003,638,2576,Sounds great. I just want to confirm some information. Would you say your quality of life and daily activities is decreasing?
3004,639,2577,"How's he doing? 
Guest_family: Not so great. He's been out of it. He hasn't been acting like himself."
3005,639,2577,"How long has it been since you noticed any behavioral changes? 
Guest_family: A few days now."
3006,639,2577,"Is he complaining of any pain? 
Guest_family: Yeah he's been-"
3007,639,2577,"He's been? 
Guest_family: Sorry, my phone was on vibrate and I had to turn it off."
3008,639,2577,"No problem. 
Guest_family: He's been pointing to his stomach and saying it hurts."
3009,639,2577,"Is he having any other symptoms? 
Guest_family: He's told me he feels queasy. I took his temperature the other night and he was running a fever of one O two."
3010,639,2577,"Any vomiting with the nausea? 
Guest_family: Yeah, he's thrown up a handful of times."
3011,640,2577,"Good morning, sir. Remind me please, when was your surgery?"
3012,640,2578,"Great, and just to remind you, you had a removal of Ex Fix from the right knee with an M U A following O R I F of a right tibial plateau fracture."
3013,640,2579,It stands for manipulation under anesthesia. We bent the knee in order to forcibly break up some scar tissue.
3014,640,2580,"Yeah, it's great, eliminates some need for P T in fact. How are you doing today?"
3015,640,2581,"Are you having any flu like, or infection symptoms?"
3016,640,2582,"So, no fever, or chills, or sweating at night."
3017,640,2583,"Great. I see you're having some drainage from the pin sites, but that doesn't bother me too much."
3018,640,2584,No need to worry. Are you doing your range of motion exercises? Those are imperative.
3019,640,2585,"Good, and do you have any numbness or tingling?"
3020,641,2586,"Hi, how are you doing?"
3021,641,2587,"How old are you, young lady?"
3022,641,2588,What brings you here?
3023,641,2589,Okay. Um? Can you tell me a little detail about anything you experienced before or diagnosed before?
3024,641,2590,That's fine. Let me go through your medical record first.
3025,641,2590,"Let's see what we have here. Looks like you have your plate full. Your record says you had hypertension I mean, high blood pressure. Also, you have a history of severe tricuspid regurgitation with mild pulmonary hypertension, mild aortic stenosis, and previously moderate mitral regurgitation."
3026,641,2591,"Ha ha. So, it says here they they want me to check you for atrial fibrillation. Yet another fancy word to add to your list."
3027,641,2592,"It means I must check if you have faster than normal heartbeat after your fall. In simple words, just to check if there are any irregularities in your heart beating, okay?"
3028,641,2593,So tell me what happened? How did you fall?
3029,641,2594,Which side did you hit the rock?
3030,641,2595,What happened in the emergency room?
3031,641,2596,"Yeah, in the record it says that they found rapid atrial tachyarrhythmia. So, according to this, they have given you Cardizem and they stopped it when your heart rate came to fifties."
3032,641,2596,Let me review your electrocardiogram from emergency. It says that there was rapid heart rate. Your heart was really beating very fast and then there was one more electrocardiogram which showed that your pacemaker is acting weird.
3033,641,2597,One they did this morning shows normal rate with frequent early heartbeats. Looks like they also tested your blood. Your potassium level is three point one.
3034,641,2597,How was your heart feeling when you fell yesterday?
3035,641,2598,Did you feel the same way afterwards as well?
3036,641,2599,That is good. Do you have any pain or discomfort in your chest?
3037,641,2600,How about before the fall? Did you have any pain or discomfort in your chest before the fall?
3038,641,2601,how about shortness of breath?
3039,642,2602,So just a few quick questions before we wrap up. Do you smoke or drink?
3040,642,2603,Any drug use?
3041,642,2604,Are you sexually active?
3042,642,2605,Did you use protection in your previous encounters?
3043,642,2606,Any history of S T Ds?
3044,642,2607,Are you currently working?
3045,643,2608,Are you taking any medications for your pain?
3046,643,2609,Which one?
3047,644,2610,"Good morning, sir, I hear you're a patient of Doctor A."
3048,644,2611,Did she refer you to me?
3049,644,2612,Are you having diarrhea?
3050,644,2613,How would you describe the frequency?
3051,644,2614,How long have you known you have anemia?
3052,644,2615,What markers were evaluated in order to diagnose this?
3053,644,2616,Do you have the results of that?
3054,644,2617,"Thank you, so this shows a hemoglobin of nine, and M C V of sixty five."
3055,644,2618,"Well, actually, both of those are low."
3056,644,2619,How long have you had blood in your stool?
3057,644,2620,What has the color been like?
3058,644,2621,When was your last colonoscopy?
3059,644,2622,Was there any abnormality found?
3060,644,2623,Were those polyps evaluated?
3061,644,2624,"I see, when was the last time you were treated for diarrhea?"
3062,645,2625,"Good afternoon, before we begin, what are your pronouns?"
3063,645,2626,"Thank you, so, have you ever had surgery?"
3064,645,2627,"That's really helpful, may I see it?"
3065,645,2628,"Thank you. So I see you've had a multiple bowel surgeries, including, um, a hysterectomy, rectocele repair, and an appendectomy. Do all of those sound familiar."
3066,645,2629,Are there any other major conditions I should be aware of?
3067,645,2630,"That's all great information to know, thank you very much."
3068,646,2630,"Hello Mister Strange, can you please confirm your age and ethnicity for the records."
3069,646,2631,"Let's first talk about your medical condition. There has been a diagnosis of polycythemia vera with secondary myelofibrosis. Also, you are J A K two positive. Do you remember when you were diagnosed?"
3070,646,2632,They did phlebotomy and then subsequently you got yourself transferred here in our healthcare.
3071,646,2633,"You have been on hydroxyurea and interferon, right?"
3072,646,2634,You do not have any siblings that we can try for transplant match?
3073,646,2635,"You were also considered for the Matched Unrelated Donor Transplant, but you couldn't be on the list due to social support and also health was in reasonably better state than other candidates normally on that transplant list."
3074,646,2636,"Yes, here we started you on a trial of lenalidomide and prednisone for some time. You were doing great on that for a while, but then you developed intolerance to lenalidomide."
3075,646,2637,"Yeah, here it says that you injured your leg? Tell me what happened."
3076,646,2638,Any other related complaints?
3077,646,2639,Do you smoke or drink?
3078,646,2640,"Okay, your overall performance status in the E C O G scale is one."
3079,647,2640,"Do you have any family history of neurological disorders, such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's or dementia?"
3080,648,2641,How long have you had this rash?
3081,648,2642,Is it causing you any pain?
3082,648,2643,Is the rash localized to the left arm?
3083,649,2644,"Hello. How are you both doing today? 
Guest_family: We're doing great. The E D told us to come here. We're here to see if we could get the stuff in his leg taken out."
3084,649,2644,"I see. Did he have a fracture before? 
Guest_family: Yeah, he did. Here's the report from the surgery from October two thousand and seven."
3085,649,2644,"Great. Let me take a look. It looks like he had a distracted left lateral condyle fracture. He then underwent screw compression to fix the fracture, correct? 
Guest_family: That's correct."
3086,649,2644,"Perfect. So, now we just have to remove the hardware that was used to fix the fracture, right? 
Guest_family: Yeah, that's correct. What are the risks of the surgery?"
3087,649,2644,"The risks include the risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of extremity, failure of removal of hardware, failure to relieve pain or improved range of motion.  
Guest_family: Oh, wow. That's a lot. Could you go over the benefits?"
3088,649,2644,"Of course. Before I do, I just need to confirm your son's age. 
Guest_family: He can tell you."
3089,649,2645,"Thank you. Happy almost birthday. 
Guest_family: He gets excited about birthdays. I just have a few more questions, but it looks like we're going to go through with the surgery."
3090,650,2645,"I am looking at her x ray report and she had a sternotomy in the past.
Guest_clinician: Yes, and we placed an I C D implant and an aortic valve mechanical implant. Her pleural effusion was really worrisome causing left sided opacification of her diaphragm."
3091,650,2645,Oh I see!
3092,651,2645,What happened to your right leg?
3093,651,2646,Don't worry we will take care of this.
3094,652,2646,"We've been following you for several conditions for a while now. What seems to be the problem today, sir?"
3095,652,2647,Did you do anything that could have provoked it to come back?
3096,652,2648,Have you been taking the Flomax for your B P H?
3097,652,2649,What about the Coumadin?
3098,652,2650,"Remind me, I don't have my chart with me. What conditions have you been taking the Coumadin for?"
3099,652,2651,Thank you. Isn't this your second occurrence of gross hematuria this month?
3100,652,2652,Are you sure you haven't experienced any falls or anything recently?
3101,652,2653,Where is your pain from that fall?
3102,652,2654,Have you had your x rays taken yet?
3103,652,2655,"Okay, these x rays of the hips, knees, and ankles show severe degeneration in all areas."
3104,652,2656,I see some pretty significant arthritis in these areas.
3105,652,2657,"Well, I don't see any fractures."
3106,652,2658,When is your pain worst?
3107,652,2659,"Okay, I know you are, but be sure to keep taking the Coumadin, that helps with the stroke and A F I B."
3108,653,2660,Good morning.
3109,653,2661,Are you married?
3110,653,2662,"Good for you, what do you do for a living?"
3111,653,2663,"Even better for you, so do you drink or smoke?"
3112,653,2664,What about more illicit substances?
3113,653,2665,Do you like to work out?
3114,653,2666,"That's very good, you're keeping very healthy."
3115,654,2666,Has anyone in your family suffered from dementia?
3116,654,2667,Is there any other medical history in your family? Any other medical issues?
3117,654,2668,How old was your mom when she died?
3118,655,2669,When was the last time you had a cigarette?
3119,655,2670,"Okay, and how much did you used to smoke?"
3120,655,2671,"Okay, how about any I V drugs?"
3121,656,2672,"What brings this little guy in today? 
Guest_family: He's been complaining of a sore throat since last night. I noticed his eyes were really puffy before he went to bed and that's when I gave him some Benadryl. At that time, he also seemed nasally."
3122,656,2672,"Sorry to hear that. Did he have a fever? 
Guest_family: When I took his temperature last night, it was one O one."
3123,656,2672,"And did you give him anything for the fever? 
Guest_family: I was worried about giving him something on top of the Benadryl."
3124,656,2672,"I see. And how has he felt otherwise? 
Guest_family: He appears more sluggish than usual. Fortunately, he's eating and drinking well."
3125,656,2672,"Has he been coughing at all? 
Guest_family: No, but his voice has been a kind of raspy."
3126,656,2672,"Any shortness of breath? 
Guest_family: Um no."
3127,656,2672,"How about any episodes of vomiting, diarrhea, or stomach pain? 
Guest_family: No, I don't think so."
3128,657,2672,"Do you have any major medical conditions that I should know about, sir?"
3129,657,2673,"Well, it's broad, but it could be anything from depression to high blood pressure, to cancer."
3130,657,2674,"What about your mental health, is there anything of note there?"
3131,658,2675,Are you a student?
3132,658,2676,What are you majoring in? Or do you know yet?
3133,658,2677,Excellent! Do you live in the dorms?
3134,658,2678,Are you from the area?
3135,658,2679,"That is a beautiful place to be from. Do you use any tobacco, alcohol, or recreational drugs?"
3136,659,2680,Do you have any history of surgical procedures?
3137,660,2681,Hello Hello!
3138,660,2682,Sure thing. Let's see what is going on here. How about that?
3139,661,2683,"Okay, let's talk about your family history."
3140,661,2684,Why do you say so?
3141,661,2685,Oh-
3142,661,2686,"Oh, that is so unfortunate."
3143,662,2688,"Hey, how's it going? It's been a while."
3144,662,2689,So anything new I should know of?
3145,662,2690,What type of stuff?
3146,662,2691,Any cause for concern?
3147,662,2692,Glad to hear that.
3148,662,2693,Is this for a job?
3149,663,2694,"Have you notied her behaving strangly in any way? 
Guest_family: No. She is acting perfectly normal."
3150,663,2694,"Has she been gagging, coughing, vomiting or any other symptoms? 
Guest_family: No. The only thing that I noticed is that she spilled the liquid all over her clothes, the ground and on her hands."
3151,663,2694,"Did you see her ingest any of the fluid? 
Guest_family: No. We didn't see her put it in her mouth. I looked inside her mouth and didn't see anything."
3152,664,2694,Any past medical problems I should know of?
3153,664,2695,Any recent weight loss?

Guest_family: Yes, we do."
3169,669,2705,"Both of you?
Guest_family: Yes, but outside, not inside."
3170,669,2705,"Okay.
Guest_family: We are careful."
3171,670,2705,"Do you use any tobacco, inhalation or recreational drugs?"
3172,671,2706,How're you feeling today?
3173,671,2707,"I'm sorry, why is that?"
3174,671,2708,How would you describe the headache?

3183,671,2717,How so?

3223,685,2749,Do you know all the surgeries that you have had for this?
3224,685,2750,"Oh, good you have a list."
3225,685,2751,Okay.

3227,685,2753,Um hum.
3228,685,2754,What did the biopsy show?
3229,685,2755,Okay. Any other surgeries for your condition?
3230,685,2756,Um hum. Any other surgeries unrelated to your condition?
3231,685,2757,Have you ever had any complications during any of your surgeries?
3232,685,2758,That is very scary.
3233,686,2758,"As per your chart, I see you have C O P D and hypertension."

3272,694,2792,"Hello, sir. How are you doing?"
3273,694,2793,That's great. The previous notes said that you quit smoking. Are you still off?
3274,694,2794,"You have a great attitude. I appreciate when patient's take their health into their own hands. We can only do so much, but it is up to the patient to bring themselves in."

3285,698,2802,"Do you smoke or drink, ma'am?"

Guest_clinician: I do. She has a two year history of small cell lung cancer, which spread to both femurs, lower lumbar spine, and pelvis."
3300,702,2814,"Oh, no. Did she get chemotherapy? 
Guest_clinician: She's had chemotherapy and radiation treatments multiple times. She can't remember how many times she had those treatments because she lost track. She also said she finished a series of ten radiation treatments for pain relief."
3301,702,2814,"How are her symptoms now? 
Guest_clinician: She's currently having severe pain."
3302,702,2814,"I see. Does she have any imaging done?

3303,702,2814,"Thank you, Nurse. I'll go see her now. 
Guest_clinican: No problem."
3304,702,2814,"Hello, ma'am. What is the reason for your visit today?"

3306,702,2816,I see. Where do you feel the pain?
3307,702,2817,Do you feel it anywhere else?
3308,702,2818,Would you said the pain radiates down from your back to your knee?
3309,702,2819,"No problem. On a scale from zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain of your life, how would you rate your back and leg?"
3310,702,2820,"Oh, wow. Do you feel pain anywhere else?"
3311,702,2821,Let me check them. I'll feel around your left foot. Let me know what you feel.
3312,702,2822,I see. The nurse stated here that you had some pain spreading to your mid back too. Let me feel it really quick. Let me know how that feels.
3313,702,2823,I see. When do you feel like the pain in your body gets the worst?
3314,702,2824,"So, just sitting for long periods of time?"
3315,702,2825,Have you ever taken anything for the pain?
3316,703,2826,"Any fever, chills or rigors?"
3317,703,2827,Any blurring of vision or history of glaucoma or cataract?

3330,704,2840,Have you experienced any episodes of nausea or vomiting?
3331,704,2841,Have you noticed any blood in your bowel movements?
3332,704,2842,"Even though you have been taking the medications without any issue, for about ten years, the methotrexate may be the cause of the mouth sores and the inflammation in the small intestines. These are both common side effects from the use of methotrexate. I am not as familiar with NSAID's causing mouth sores. Aspirin use can cause gastrointestinal upset. I think the most likely cause of the sores is the methotrexate not the use of Aspirin."
3333,705,2842,Are you on insulin?
3334,705,2843,Are you on metformin as well?
3335,705,2844,How about glucotrol?

3337,706,2846,"Epi one M G, zero point three M L subcutaneously along with fifty M G of Benadryl intramuscularly. In about fifteen to twenty minutes, he reported his itching had improved. The rash itself faded a little bit and he began to feel a lot more comfortable."
3338,707,2846,"Hello, how are you?"
3339,707,2847,"So, what brings you here today?"
3340,707,2848,"Yeah, he is a good man! Don't worry we will take care of you."
3341,707,2849,"So, let me start by getting your medical history."
3342,707,2850,Okay.
3343,707,2851,Alright.
3344,707,2852,I see.
3345,708,2852,"Welcome back to Sample Clinic, Mister Sample."
3346,708,2853,"What seems to be the problem today, sir?"
3347,708,2854,How long have you had this pain?

3358,710,2864,"Hello Miss Long, I see that you have been referred today by A B C, D O, for a reevaluation. Are you having issues with your hand eczema again?"
3359,710,2865,Can you confirm your age for the records please?
3360,710,2866,"If I'm not wrong, you are from Vietnam, right?"
3361,710,2867,Are you married? Single or with a partner?
3362,710,2868,Are you working somewhere?
3363,710,2869,"Okay, since you are an established patient here in our dermatology department, let me just update all your information into the records."
3364,710,2869,Okay according to my records we have last seen you here in our office on July thirteenth of two thousand and four.
3365,710,2870,I have previously treated you with Aristocort cream and Cetaphil cream. I also ask you to increase your moisturizing cream and lotion and asked you to wash your hands in Cetaphil cleansing lotion.
3366,710,2871,Have you been washing your hands with Cetaphil cleansing lotion?
3367,710,2872,It may be because of the fissures. I mean those cracks in your hands.
3368,710,2873,Okay.
3369,711,2873,Have you been applying Triamcinolone zero point one percent three times a day to your rash?
3370,711,2874,Yes. And Bactroban ointment is also three times a day as needed for your bug bites.
3371,711,2875,Are you still using Nystatin on your lips once a day as needed?
3372,711,2876,"So let's see, your other medications are the same as of July thirtieth O four with the exception of Klonopin?"
3373,712,2877,"So, I am looking at your reports, you don't have anemia or any other blood disorders."
3374,712,2878,Yeah.
3375,712,2878,Let me check your lymph nodes. They are nonpalpable. I don't see any swollen glands or anything.
3376,713,2879,"I am well, how's the baby? I see that he is eight pounds and thirteen ounces, and he was born via…?
Guest_family: Yes, C section. Yeah, he is he has never been hospitalized. He was born a week early."
3377,713,2879,"Okay, I would like to ask you some questions about the pregnancy and other history. 
Guest_family: Yes, sure go ahead."
3378,713,2879,"Great, have you had any infections during pregnancy like G B S or S T D infections?
Guest_family: No, I haven't, I only had thumb and toenail infections and we treated that with rubbing alcohol. We have a history of boils in the family, so I am not afraid of minor infections like this."
3379,713,2879,"Did you smoke during pregnancy? 
Guest_family: Yes, I did, but stopped after five months."
3380,713,2879,"Sir, have you had any S T D while she was pregnant?
Guest_family_2: No, I was not diagnosed with anything unusual."
3381,713,2879,"Great, so looks like you were discharged in forty eight hours and no more hospital stays for you.
Guest_family: That is correct."
3382,714,2879,"Welcome to the clinic, sir. I am Doctor Jones."
3383,714,2880,Do you use tobacco products?
3384,714,2881,I am glad you are attempting to quit. We have a lot of tools now to help with cravings. How much do you smoke per day now?
3385,714,2882,Do you drink alcohol or use recreational drugs?
3386,714,2883,How many alcoholic drinks do you consume per week?
3387,714,2884,Are you physically active? Do you exercise?
3388,714,2885,What do you do for employment?
3389,714,2886,Are you married?
3390,714,2887,Do you live at home with your wife and or is there anyone else living in your home?
3391,715,2888,Are you married?
3392,715,2889,"So, do you live alone? Or do you have kids?"
3393,715,2890,Do you smoke?
3394,715,2891,What about alcohol?
3395,715,2892,Are you working?
3396,716,2893,Do you want to go home?
3397,716,2894,"Yes, you sure can."
3398,717,2894,Are you studying?
3399,717,2895,Do you live alone?
3400,718,2896,Have you ever had surgery before?
3401,718,2897,"So, no gallbladder removal, or joint replacements?"
3402,719,2898,I remember you had mentioned that one of your family members had bone cancer. Are there any other medical problems that run in your family?
3403,719,2899,I'm sorry to hear that.
3404,720,2899,Are you allergic to any meds?
3405,720,2900,Yes.
3406,720,2901,Are you sure?
3407,720,2902,Okay great!
3408,721,2902,"What's bringing her in today? 
Guest_family: Oh, doctor. She hasn't been doing well at all. 
Guest_family: I think she's actually gotten worse."
3409,721,2902,"I understand. I'm sorry to hear that she hasn't been feeling well. Let me see what we can do for her today. 
Guest_family: I haven't taken her temperature since this morning. It was one hundred and three degrees when she woke up."
3410,721,2902,"What time did she wake up today? 
Guest_family: Um, around eight I believe. She also suffers from apnea."
3411,721,2902,"It looks like she has an upper respiratory infection. 
Guest_family: Is she going to get better?"
3412,721,2902,"Yes, she should feel better once we start treating the infection. But I'm worried it may be pertussis."
3413,722,2902,"And you've had recurring abscesses for the past two years, correct?"
3414,722,2903,Where have they been located?
3415,722,2904,Have you ever needed to get an abscess drained?
3416,723,2905,How's your overall health?
3417,724,2906,Do you have any family history of chronic illnesses that I should know about?
3418,724,2907,"Well, it could be anything from depression, to arthritis, to cancer."
3419,725,2908,How are you moving around? Are you able to perform your day to day activities?
3420,725,2909,So just listen to your body and go around as much as you can.
3421,725,2910,Do not overstress yourself.
3422,726,2911,Are you allergic to anything?
3423,726,2912,Okay.
3424,727,2913,"Remind me, how did he hurt himself?
Guest_family_1: He was riding quads on October tenth two thousand seven when he got thrown off."
3425,727,2913,"Yes, and we did O R I F on his fracture dislocation of the left elbow. 
Guest_family_1: Yes, he also fractured the neck of his right glenoid, um, if I remember correctly."
3426,727,2913,"Which hand does he write with? 
Guest_family_1: He writes with his right hand."
3427,727,2913,"Okay. That fracture appears to have healed very well; kids generally heal pretty well. How does it feel today? 
Guest_family_1: Yes, he's only ten. He's been pretty stiff, so he's been going to P T, and using his Dynasplint."
3428,727,2913,"That's good that he is already in P T. His left elbow fracture is healed, so we should do another surgery in order to remove that hardware. That may help decrease some of the irritation with elbow extension. He looks neurologically intact in terms of movement and reflexed in his wrist and hand. 
Guest_family_1: Yes, I agree. What is the risk of infection of this surgery?"
3429,727,2913,"Historically, the risk of infection is less than one percent. 
Guest_family_1: Oh, wow, that's low, how is that possible?"
3430,727,2913,"We'll use prophylactic antibiotics, this controls for infection, and helps keep everything clean. Other Risks include bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremities, failure to remove hardware, failure to relieve pain, and continued postoperative stiffness.
Guest_family_1: Wow, that's great, will be he asleep the entire time?"
3431,727,2913,"Yes, we'll use anesthesia, he won't feel a thing. 
Guest_family_1: Will this fix his pain, for sure?"
3432,727,2913,"I can't guarantee it, he may still be in some pain. 
Guest_family_1: Okay, what about you, dear? What do you think?
Guest_family_2: Yeah, I think we should do it, boys should be playing sports with their friends."
3433,728,2913,"Since you have a family history of coronary heart disease, let me check you for its risk factors."
3434,728,2914,Any history of high blood pressure or diabetes?
3435,728,2915,"How about smoking, do you smoke?"
3436,728,2916,"And in the past, did any other Doctor mention that you might have sign or symptom indicating that you may have coronary artery disease?"
3437,728,2917,Okay.
3438,729,2917,"Who all are there in your family?
Guest_family: It's me, my husband, my two older kids and this little baby."
3439,729,2917,"Everyone living together?
Guest_family: Yes"
3440,729,2917,"Is she going to any daycare?
Guest_family: No, she's at home all the time."
3441,730,2917,Do you drink?
3442,730,2918,"Okay. How about cigarettes, do you smoke?"
3443,731,2919,I am okay.
3444,731,2920,"Oh, so sorry."
3445,731,2921,Okay let me see what is going on.
3446,732,2922,What brings you into the office today?
3447,732,2923,Is it only the right side of the face that is affected by paralysis?
3448,732,2924,That is a good sign. It can take up to six months see how much movement you will regain.
3449,733,2924,Do you use tobacco?
3450,733,2925,"Yes ma'am, do you?"
3451,734,2926,"Have you ever had surgery, ma'am?"
3452,734,2927,"I see here that you had a hysterectomy as well, is that correct?"
3453,735,2928,"So, let's see here. You don't recall anyone in your family having a history of neuromuscular diseases, correct?"
3454,735,2929,Do you know of anyone who has had foot deformities or neuropathy in their arms or legs?
3455,735,2930,Great. Does anyone in your immediate family have a high arch?
3456,735,2931,And you said that your aunt or sister has type two diabetes?
3457,736,2932,"So, what I feel is you might have short term memory loss due to high stress, but I also feel it's probably due to your current situation. The other impression I have is that you have anxiety issues and again it's stress related."
3458,737,2933,"Who's my patient today?
Guest_family: Today, it's my brother."
3459,737,2933,"What seems to be the problem today?
Guest_family: Well, he's a vegetarian but he has high cholesterol and he's on a medication to control it."
3460,737,2933,"Has he changed his diet?
Guest_family: Yes, he did when he got a letter saying that his fat levels were high in the blood."
3461,737,2933,What kinds of foods did he eliminate?
3462,737,2934,Do you take your lunch to work?
3463,737,2935,Are you exercising right now?
3464,737,2936,What kind do you like to do?
3465,737,2937,How long do you workout per day?
3466,737,2938,"Good, are you training for anything specific?"
3467,737,2939,Can I assume you're losing weight?
3468,738,2940,"The patient has possible free air in their diaphragm. 
Guest_clinician: How old is the patient?"
3469,738,2940,"Seventy six. 
Guest_clinician: Past medical history?"
3470,738,2940,Unknown as of now.
3471,739,2940,"Out of ten, ten being the worst pain imaginable, how would you rate your pain today?"
3472,739,2941,Does the pain change with the weather?
3473,739,2942,Does the pain change throughout the course of the day?
3474,739,2943,"Out of ten, how would you rate your pain at night?"
3475,739,2944,Does the pain wake you up at night?
3476,739,2945,Are there any activities that really aggravate the pain?
3477,739,2946,Does anything alleviate the pain?
3478,740,2947,"Okay. It's mentioned in her report that she has a history of smoking.
Guest_family: She is nodding yes."
3479,740,2947,"Well, it's alright. I think it's going to be difficult taking any past medical information from her."
3480,741,2947,Have you been taking anything for high blood pressure?
3481,741,2948,Hm are you talking about Avalide?
3482,742,2949,"Good afternoon, ma'am. Before we begin, may I ask how old you are?"
3483,742,2950,"Great, thank you. What seems to be the problem today, ma'am?"
3484,742,2951,"Why would that be, ma'am?"
3485,742,2952,"Tell me more about your eating habits, please."
3486,742,2953,Are you struggling to make food for just two people?
3487,742,2954,"I understand, are you busy, do you work?"
3488,743,2955,Hello! What brings you into the office today?
3489,743,2956,Have you recently had any surgical procedures?
3490,743,2957,Do you have a history of an enlarged prostate or kidney stones?
3491,743,2958,I would like to get some imaging done.
3492,744,2959,"Has he ever had any mental retardation problems in the past? 
Guest_family: No."
3493,744,2959,"Did he go through mainstream education? 
Guest_family: Yes, he graduated high school last year. He had an I E P. He has a job now."
3494,744,2959,"Oh really. That's great. 
Guest_family: We went through a program for the disabled to find him the job. He is doing well."
3495,744,2959,"What is the job? 
Guest_family: He works at cardboard shop."
3496,744,2959,"So, he is ambulatory. No issues with performing the work. 
Guest_family: No! His boss said he is doing very well."
3497,745,2959,"And you are-
Guest_family: Hi, I am her nurse."
3498,745,2959,"So, do you know about her past medical history?
Guest_family: I have very limited information, as I very recently started working with her. She does have dementia and that's the main reason why I was hired. Her family wanted someone to look after her twenty four seven."
3499,745,2959,"Oh, I see. 
Guest_family: But I do have her medical records. You can have a look."
3500,745,2959,"Yeah, that will be nice. Let me check her reports quickly. She has a history schizophrenia, chronic anemia and hypothyroidism and she also suffers from asthma. 
Guest_family: Yes."
3501,745,2959,"Oh, I also see here she tested positive for P P D, was she diagnosed with tuberculosis? 
Guest_family: I honestly don't know, but I wasn't told that."
3502,745,2959,Okay.
3503,746,2959,"Your last visit was on April seventh two thousand five, correct."
3504,746,2960,"That's right. So, has anything changed since then?"
3505,747,2961,"Any nausea, vomiting or diarrhea?"
3506,748,2962,"Well, I think she has hay fever. Otherwise she looks like a healthy two year old.
Guest_family: Hm, okay."
3507,749,2962,"Hello, sir. I'll be your doctor today. How are you feeling?"
3508,749,2963,You're in the emergency room.
3509,749,2964,The police found you outside of the local bar. Do you remember what happened prior to your arrival here?
3510,749,2965,"No, you're here because someone was worried you may need medical attention."
3511,750,2966,How's your husband doing?
3512,750,2967,Happy to hear that he's also doing well.
3513,750,2968,I just have one more question for you regarding your social history. Do you smoke?
3514,750,2969,"Okay, so no changes."
3515,751,2969,How are you feeling today?
3516,751,2970,Are you sleeping well?
3517,751,2971,Have you been able to eat without any trouble?
3518,751,2972,Have you been able to have a bowel movement yet?
3519,751,2973,Did you experience any difficulties with your movement?
3520,751,2974,"Okay. Continue the high fiber diet that we discussed, and it should improve. Please let me or one of the nurses know if it has not improved or becomes worse."
3521,752,2974,"Our records show that he is up to date with his vaccinations.
Guest_family: Okay."
3522,753,2974,Are you allergic to any medications?
3523,754,2975,"So, do you remember when your last pap smear was?"
3524,754,2976,"Great, do you have any children?"
3525,754,2977,That's wonderful. Have you only been pregnant once?
3526,755,2978,Have you undergone any surgeries?
3527,755,2979,And that was a-
3528,755,2980,It's alright. I just wanted to know if that polyp was found in your colon?
3529,756,2981,"Yes for sure.
Guest_family: He has a fever."
3530,757,2981,Where's your rash?
3531,757,2982,When did you first notice it?
3532,757,2983,Have you found yourself itching it?
3533,757,2984,"Any potential triggers for the rash, such as dietary changes, new medications, or unfamiliar exposures?"
3534,757,2985,"Any shortness of breath, wheezing, facial swelling, tongue or lip swelling, or other associated symptoms?"
3535,758,2986,Are you allergic to anything?
3536,758,2987,"Yes, sorry. I was referring to drug allergies."
3537,758,2988,What happens when you take Sulfa drugs?
3538,758,2989,"Wow, I'm sorry. Rashes can be very uncomfortable and sometimes require immediate attention."
3539,759,2990,Do you smoke?
3540,759,2991,How much do you smoke?
3541,760,2992,Does any of your family member have any major medical problems?
3542,760,2993,Anything anyone else?
3543,761,2994,Where's your pain?
3544,761,2995,Does the pain come and go?
3545,761,2996,Do you find that sitting or laying down in certain positions helps the pain?
3546,761,2997,Have you taken any medicine for the pain?
3547,761,2998,Yes?
3548,761,2999,Did they already take you back for your C T scan?
3549,761,3000,"We should be getting the results of your scan fairly soon then. In the meantime, I'm going to put in some additional orders."
3550,762,3001,"So, I've reviewed your past notes, are there any other diagnoses I should know about?"
3551,762,3002,Thank you for sharing that with me.
3552,763,3002,"Good afternoon, ma'am."
3553,763,3003,"So, what do you do for a living?"
3554,763,3004,"That's okay, I'm not here to judge. Are you married?"
3555,763,3005,"Good for you, do you have any kids?"
3556,763,3006,Do you drink or smoke?
3557,763,3007,"Good, and do you use anything harder? Like illicit drugs?"
3558,763,3008,"Good, and with ten being the most stressful day every, how would you rate your stress level out of ten?"
3559,764,3009,Hello. How are you doing today?
3560,764,3010,"I see. Did the nurse come in and ask you questions about past medical history?
Guest_clinician: Sorry, Doctor. I was looking for you. I reviewed his history with him, and nothing has changed."
3561,764,3010,Perfect. Let's do some tests to see why your head has been hurting.
3562,765,3011,We're going to check around your knee now.
3563,765,3012,Looks like your deep tendon reflexes are the same on both legs. Sensation seems great and intact.
3564,766,3012,Can you tell me something about your family? Any illnesses in family?
3565,766,3013,Okay.
3566,766,3014,Is there any history of death of child who was less than a year maybe?
3567,766,3015,Okay. That's great. No illnesses for small children?
3568,767,3016,"Alright, I am looking at your urine report and it confirms what I was suspecting. You have a urinary tract infection."
3569,767,3017,"Oh yes, it is because you got something called as acute cystitis and its usually very painful and can cause some serious complications."
3570,767,3018,"I am afraid I don't have better news for you, but your diabetes is out of control. It's way too high and you must be really careful. Are you taking your medicines?"
3571,767,3019,How bout diet?
3572,767,3020,"Well, you must watch your diet, you can't just be careless. I am going to change your diabetes medication. And let's start you on the antibiotic that should give you relief. Also stay hydrated drink plenty of fluids it will help you flush the infection out."
3573,767,3021,Take care.
3574,768,3021,"Good morning, ma'am."
3575,768,3022,"Before we begin, I just have a few questions. Do you remember what illnesses you had as a child?"
3576,769,3023,Hi there! I am Doctor Sherman.
3577,769,3024,It looks like your P C P sent you to us for a possible prostate problem.
3578,769,3025,"Do not be nervous. We will start with discussing the symptoms you have been experiencing, a physical exam and then we will get a urine sample if you are able."
3579,770,3026,What are you taking for allergies?
3580,770,3027,Okay.
3581,771,3028,Do you have any known allergies to medication?
3582,772,3029,What is your family medical history?
3583,772,3030,I am so sorry to hear that.
3584,772,3031,Do you know of any other major health conditions in your family?
3585,772,3032,That's good.
3586,773,3032,"Hello, sir how are you feeling today?"
3587,774,3033,"So, we looked at your previous blood work results, now let me see what these reports say from today's C B C exam."
3588,774,3034,"Okay so your hemoglobin levels look within range, white counts are thirteen point three, then seven point six lymphocytes and twenty six thousand platelets."
3589,774,3034,Okay?
3590,775,3035,Welcome back.
3591,775,3036,"You are back for a follow up on your right arm pain, right?"
3592,775,3037,How has your arm been feeling?
3593,775,3038,How long does the pain last?
3594,775,3039,Remind me again. You are right handed. Right?
3595,775,3040,I bet it does. Are you experiencing any numbness or tingling sensation in your arm or hand?
3596,775,3041,Do you have a history of any other neck or shoulder injuries?
3597,775,3042,Did you see anyone for the neck pain?
3598,775,3043,Are you still seeing Doctor X for the epidural injections?
3599,775,3044,How old are you?
3600,775,3045,Are you experiencing any symptoms from receiving the injections?
3601,775,3046,What medications have you been taking for the pain?
3602,775,3047,Okay.
3603,775,3048,Okay. Does the pain prevent you from doing your daily activities or decrease your quality of life?
3604,776,3049,What type of surgery have you had in past? Anything big or small?
3605,776,3050,Okay.
3606,777,3050,Are you currently taking any medications?
3607,778,3051,So are you allergic-
3608,779,3052,Hello again!
3609,779,3053,The results from you M R I showed nothing concerning.  The growth factors were normal with normal cell function and no signs of decreased blood supply to the brain.
3610,779,3054,Yes it is.
3611,780,3054,"So, I understand that you had a fall."
3612,780,3055,What happened?
3613,780,3056,Are you left or right handed?
3614,780,3057,Can you tell me a little bit more about the trouble that you are having with the right hand? Is it localized to the right hand?
3615,780,3058,How long has this issue been progressing for?
3616,780,3059,Have you experienced any blurred vision or visual disturbances?
3617,780,3060,How old are you?
3618,780,3061,Happy belated birthday!
3619,780,3062,Did your P C P have any bloodwork or imaging done?
3620,780,3063,Oh. I see it here! Did Doctor Madison discuss the results of your H C T and the M R I yet?
3621,780,3064,"Okay. The results showed clinoid masses. This explains that problems that you have been having with your right side, your balancing problems, and the visual disturbances. With only the M R I I cannot tell if the masses are malignant or not."
3622,780,3065,I don't know yet. I will have to run some more tests and potently have to do a biopsy.
3623,781,3066,Do you smoke?
3624,781,3067,How much? I mean can you tell me approximate amount?
3625,781,3068,How about alcohol and drugs?
3626,782,3069,"With ten being the worst pain imaginable, how would you rate your pain today out of ten, ma'am?"
3627,782,3070,How would you describe your pain?
3628,782,3071,Where is your pain located?
3629,782,3072,What activities make your surgery worse?
3630,782,3073,"Before this pain, how would you describe your activity level?"
3631,782,3074,Are you able to do any of your prior activities?
3632,783,3075,Welcome in!
3633,783,3076,Let us get a little background. What is your medical history?
3634,783,3077,What kind of memory problems?
3635,783,3078,Do you know what kind of seizures that you have?
3636,783,3079,Do you have any other health conditions?
3637,783,3080,Okay.
3638,784,3080,Did you have any medical issues?
3639,784,3081,What about surgery.
3640,785,3082,How old are you?
3641,785,3083,Are you right handed or left handed?
3642,785,3084,"So, I see the chief complaint is memory loss and cognitive decline. Tell me what exactly happened, and how did you notice the symptoms? Let me document that today is January twelfth of nineteen ninety five.
Guest_family: We noticed it the week prior to Thanksgiving last year in nineteen ninety four. We have a family tradition where we play a game and this time, we were taking her to Vail, Colorado to play ""Murder She Wrote"" at one of our family gatherings. She was chosen to be the assassin."
3643,785,3084,"Okay. 
Guest_family: Kids played a trick with her and they hid a plastic gun, a toy gun in her luggage. As she walked through the security, the alarm went off and like within seconds she was all surrounded, and everyone was like panicked. There was so much panic, they searched her and interrogated her and what not. Eventually she and her family made it to the flight, and she seemed unusually frustrated and disoriented by all that. Previously, if any such incident would have happened in the past, she would just have like chuckled and brushed it off. And we all would have sat together and laughed about it. This time it was different."
3644,785,3084,"I can see why she was frustrated. Anyone can be in such situations. 
Guest_family: When we were in Colorado, she seemed slow. She had difficulty reading her lines to her part when we were playing that game. She needed assistance to complete the whole game."
3645,785,3084,"Was she slurring?
Guest_family: Nope."
3646,785,3084,"Was there any difficulty with vision? Or any weakness? 
Guest_family: Nope. Nothing that we noticed."
3647,785,3084,"How was it after returning from there? 
Guest_family: She returned to work. She used to work in a local florist shop. She returned on the Monday following Thanksgiving. And she had difficulty."
3648,785,3085,"How was it after that? 
Guest_family: She seemed to be doing fine and stable throughout November and December, and we were visiting a local neurologist as well, who was evaluating her. He did a few blood tests and did uh, M R I of the brain. He gave us all clear. He said there's nothing there."
3649,785,3085,"Yeah, I see the working diagnosis of dementia of the Alzheimer's Type. When did these symptoms increase? Like when did you started noticing them more? 
Guest_family: One or two weeks ago, so end of December nineteen ninety four, she got lost in her own home. She was getting more sensitive and started saying that she is becoming a liability for everyone, which is not at all like her. Her walking was affected. She started walking like a bended form and also started veering to the right. She also did not recognize the location of where people were talking to her."
3650,786,3085,You are not allergic to anything?
3651,786,3086,Any food or other pollen?
3652,786,3087,Great!
3653,787,3087,April twenty two three we checked your list of medications.
3654,787,3087,We saw that it lifts up in the morning and evening.
3655,787,3087,Yeah.
3656,788,3088,"How old is the baby? 
Guest_family: He is twenty one months old."
3657,788,3088,"What brings you here today?
Guest_family: I have concerns about his motor development. Many times he seems to have lazy eyes and sometimes I can notice his jaw quivering."
3658,788,3088,"How was your pregnancy? 
Guest_family: I had no complications in my pregnancy with him. My labor was very spontaneous, and it was a normal delivery."
3659,788,3088,"Is this the only child?
Guest_family: No, I have two more kids."
3660,788,3088,"How much did he weigh at birth? 
Guest_family: He was around eight pounds and ten ounces."
3661,788,3088,"Did you remember his milestones?
Guest_family: Yes, I have all of it written down for all of my three kids and I brought this with me. He sat on his own by seven months. He was able to stand by eleven months and crawled around sixteen months but he was not walking until eighteen months."
3662,788,3088,"What issues are he facing right now? 
Guest_family: He falls a lot. He cannot walk properly. He is kind of in toeing on his left. He's able to feed himself properly. He also throws, um, he picks up the things and throws them. His upper body looks strong."
3663,788,3088,"How about his speech? How many words do you think he knows? 
Guest_family: He knows more than twenty words for sure."
3664,788,3088,"Is he able to speak two word phrases? 
Guest_family: Yes. He says things like ,”give me,” and, “come here.”"
3665,788,3088,"Any other unusual behavior that you noticed? Any seizures or just the quivering movement of the jaw? 
Guest_family: No, it was only this and we have noticed this since birth. I don't know if it is related but I did notice that his left eye deviates outside."
3666,789,3088,What brings you back into the clinic today?
3667,789,3089,"You are taking a normal start dose. Some people do not metabolize the medication as well as others. I would like to get you tested for hypersensitivity. After we get the test results back, we will be able to adjust your dosage accordingly."
3668,790,3090,"Let me examine you. Tell me, did you have any fever or chills, any sweating or that sort of thing?"
3669,790,3091,How about abnormal weight loss or weight gain?
3670,790,3092,Are you experiencing any chest pain on exertion or shortness of breath normally or when you try to sleep?
3671,790,3093,Let me see your legs. They look good I don't see any pedal edema. Usually that happens due to excess water retention. Any palpitations?
3672,790,3094,Any feeling of numbness or tingling? Did you faint or lose consciousness anytime?
3673,790,3095,"Okay, good!"
3674,790,3095,Any double and or blurred vision?
3675,790,3096,Any difficulty hearing or any wired continuous sound you may hear?
3676,790,3097,"Okay, um tell me if you had any um, allergies, or sneezing, or runny nose?"
3677,790,3098,"Okay, got it."
3678,790,3098,"Any indigestion, or heart burn? Did you notice any blood in stool or black stool?"
3679,790,3099,Any diarrhea or vomiting?
3680,790,3100,Are you feeling thirsty frequently?
3681,790,3101,Okay.
3682,790,3101,"And I see you got a urine test, so no pus cells or blood present."
3683,790,3102,Any pain while passing urine though? Any blood?
3684,790,3103,And how is the urine frequency? Do you have to wake up at night to urinate?
3685,790,3104,How bout the stream while passing urine? You think it's normal or somewhat slow?
3686,790,3105,"Okay, so any cough or cold like symptoms any sputum?"
3687,790,3106,"No wheezing, right?"
3688,790,3107,"I don't see any lesions, that's good. Any mood swings, feeling depressed or have anxiety?"
3689,790,3108,"Any joint pain in the legs, back or anywhere?"
3690,790,3109,"Okay, so no erythema in the joints. Any heat or cold intolerance?"
3691,790,3110,"Okay, any difficulty swallowing? Let me check here, lymph nodes look fine. And do you bleed easily and does the bleeding stop normally?"
3692,790,3111,Do you bruise easy?
3693,790,3112,Okay. Any abnormal skin lesions?
3694,791,3113,Are you allright?
3695,791,3114,That's great.
3696,791,3115,I think you can go home now.
3697,792,3115,"I'm reviewing my notes from your last visit. Your last visit was on May tenth two thousand four, correct?"
3698,792,3116,Has there been any change since your last visit?
3699,792,3117,"Have you been treated, and are you taking medicine for this?"
3700,793,3118,"I just met with one of my patients whom I believe has pertussis. 
Guest_clinician: Second case of the day. What's their name and date of birth?"
3701,793,3118,Hm give me a second to pull up their information.
3702,794,3118,Have you ever had psychiatric or psychological treatment?
3703,795,3119,Do you remember when your last flu vaccine was?
3704,795,3120,"Good, and do you remember your last pneumonia vaccine?"
3705,795,3121,"Thank you, now, tell me more about your parents. Do you know their medical histories?"
3706,795,3122,How old is your father?
3707,795,3123,"Good, what about your mother?"
3708,795,3124,I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have any brothers or sisters?
3709,796,3125,"How are you doing today, ma'am?"
3710,796,3126,Any kind of alcohol consumption?
3711,796,3127,Have you ever taken any kind of illegal drugs?
3712,796,3128,What about smoking?
3713,796,3129,Are you still working?
3714,797,3130,Do you have any chest pain?
3715,797,3131,Any breathlessness?
3716,797,3132,Okay. How about any bowel issues?
3717,797,3133,Okay frequency. How about any prolonged bleeding issues or anything like that sort?
3718,798,3134,"Does she lives with anyone? 
Guest_family: Yes, we all stay together, so just the immediate family. My parents, me and my sister."
3719,798,3134,Okay.
3720,799,3134,"Hi, the weather outside is beautiful, did you get some sunshine?"
3721,799,3135,Great way to get some exercise in.
3722,799,3135,ok so what's going on?
3723,799,3136,Since when?
3724,799,3137,Can you tell me more about your pain like how did it start and what exactly are you feeling?
3725,799,3138,Can you tell me if it is stabbing pain and if it is related to any specific time of the day?
3726,799,3139,Can you tell me when exactly you noted it?
3727,799,3140,I can see that they found H pylori positive infection and treated you with triple drug therapy for two weeks and then gave you antacid omeprazole. But it did not improve your pain.
3728,799,3142,Ok tell me how are your bowel movements and if you see any blood in stools?
3729,799,3143,Are you taking any pain medication over the counter? Do you drink alcohol and maybe you are vomiting blood?
3730,799,3144,Can you tell me if any change in position changes the quality of pain? do you have any fever?
3731,799,3145,Have you been exercising before all this?
3732,800,3146,Any specific family medical history that I should be aware of?
3733,800,3147,"Anyone in your family, even grandparents, if you know them, did they have diabetes or high blood pressure?"
3734,800,3148,Anyone else sick at home?
3735,801,3149,What is your family medical history?
3736,801,3150,Is your mother still with us after the stroke?
3737,801,3151,Good. What about your father's medical history?
3738,801,3152,I am so sorry to hear that.
3739,802,3153,Anyone in your family have a history of drug or alcohol abuse?
3740,802,3154,Any other medical conditions that might run in your family?
3741,803,3155,Do you drink?
3742,803,3156,"No, just in general."
3743,803,3157,Do you smoke?
3744,804,3158,Any drug allergies?
3745,804,3159,Naprosyn?
3746,805,3160,"Hi, how old are you madam?"
3747,805,3161,Ha! Not so old okay!
3748,805,3162,Oh I am so sorry to hear that.
3749,805,3163,"Let's see here. So you already have a right hip issue, bone disease, hypertension, depression, and heart rhythm disorder for a long time."
3750,805,3164,Let me see what we can do here.
3751,806,3165,Do you drink?
3752,806,3166,Did you ever smoke?
3753,806,3167,How about drugs? Marijuana or anything?
3754,806,3168,Good. And what is your living arrangement? Do you stay with your kids?
3755,806,3169,Okay.
3756,807,3169,"Good afternoon, how old are you?"
3757,807,3170,What gender do you identify with?
3758,807,3171,Thank you. What symptoms are you experiencing in your right hand?
3759,807,3172,Are there any specific fingers that you feel it in?
3760,807,3173,What kind of treatments have you done for this pain?
3761,807,3174,Has this helped at all?
3762,807,3175,"This sounds like carpal tunnel, there's a quick, minimally invasive surgery I can do on this hand, since it hasn't responded to nonoperative treatments. I think that'll really help."
3763,807,3176,Its called a carpal tunnel release.
3764,808,3176,"Oh, how long?
Guest_family: It's been three weeks now."
3765,808,3176,"Okay.
Guest_family: He has been like this for so long, but nothing else."
3766,808,3176,"How about fever nausea vomiting diarrhea?
Guest_family: No fever, no vomiting, nothing else."
3767,808,3176,Okay great.
3768,809,3176,What do you do? Are you working or in school?
3769,809,3177,Good.
3770,810,3178,"Do you have any children, ma'am?"
3771,810,3179,"Wonderful, were there any complications with your pregnancy or delivery?"
3772,810,3180,"Good, have you ever been hospitalized for any issue?"
3773,810,3181,"Good, so I can assume you've never had surgery?"
3774,811,3182,Any past surgeries that I should know of?
3775,811,3183,Both hips?
3776,811,3184,Total?
3777,811,3185,Got it.
3778,811,3186,Do you happen to remember who did your most recent surgeries?
3779,811,3187,"That's no problem. I should be able to look it up from my end, too."
3780,812,3187,Where do you live?
3781,812,3188,"Are you the mother of the patient? 
Guest_family: Yes, I'm the mother."
3782,812,3188,"How are you dealing with everything? 
Guest_family: We just want what is best for him. We want to support him in every possible way. He has only one elder sister. She lives in Texas and she also wants the same for him. Before he started living with us, he has been living in the A B C D places and some were in very bad condition. He was not striving there. That's why we asked him to move in with us."
3783,813,3188,Are you taking any medications?
3784,813,3189,"Okay, any other medicines?"
3785,813,3190,Okay.
3786,814,3190,"Do you have any history of surgeries, sir?"
3787,814,3191,How was the recovery for that?
3788,814,3192,That is good. Have you had any other surgeries?
3789,814,3193,Okay.
3790,814,3194,Okay. Is that all?
3791,815,3195,Do you have any past medical problems that I should know about?
3792,815,3196,"Well, it could be anything from A D H D to depression to epilepsy."
3793,816,3197,"So, lets talk about your family, anybody in your family have any neurological problems?"
3794,816,3198,"Yeah, that is true. And how about your brothers and sisters, do you have any?"
3795,816,3199,Okay.
3796,817,3199,Do you have any family history of heart disease?
3797,818,3200,"Hello, miss X Y Z. Dr. X and I will go over your report with you to make sure everything is correct. Then, I will ask you a few questions."
3798,818,3202,"Doctor A B  C requested for you to see us, correct?"
3799,818,3203,"Perfect. Doctor X, could you go over her previous diagnoses? 
Doctor_2: She is diagnosed with hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease. Is this all correct, ma'am?"
3800,818,3204,"I see she underwent a procedure. What was it, Doctor X? 
Doctor_2: She underwent a decompression for L three and L four. Did Doctor Stanley Gertzbein perform this procedure for your back?"
3801,818,3205,"I see after the surgery, you had some pain in your right L four distribution, correct?"
3802,818,3206,"Doctor X, did the M R I report of the outside lumbar come in? 
Doctor_2: It did. We also have a report of a lumbar C T myelogram, but no films came."
3803,818,3206,"What does the C T myelogram say? 
Doctor_2: It says she has spondylolisthesis and L four and L 5 stenosis with right posterior surgical fusion changes at both levels."
3804,818,3206,"I see. There are some notes from Doctor Reitman. What does it say? 
Doctor_2: It looks like she is being sent for an L four selective nerve root block to rule out if she would be a candidate for a T L I F at L four and L 5."
3805,818,3206,"I see. Could you review the M R I film as well? 
Doctor_2: The M R I reveal a grade two L four anterior spondylolisthesis without major canal stenosis. She does, however, have facet joint disease at this level and dorsal postoperative changes. She also has a foraminal disc protrusion on the right and a severely degenerated disc at L three and L four."
3806,818,3206,"Thank you for that. So, miss. Where are you feeling pain today?"
3807,818,3207,What kind of pain are you feeling?
3808,818,3208,I see. Is it worse when you do certain activities?
3809,818,3209,Are you able to walk at all?
3810,818,3210,When does it feel better?
3811,818,3211,"From a scale of zero to ten, with ten being the worst pain, how would you rate the pain on average?"
3812,818,3212,"That's the intensity on a daily level, correct?"
3813,818,3213,What's the lowest pain you've ever felt?
3814,818,3214,"I see. Doctor X, did you ask her the series of questions about bowel function? 
Doctor_2: I did. She denied any bowel or bladder dysfunction, saddle area hypoesthesia, numbness, tingling, weakness or Valsalva related exacerbation."
3815,818,3214,Great. Have you taken any medication recently?
3816,819,3217,"No, nothing like that. You can have a normal diet. Whatever you like to eat."
3817,819,3218,"Well, I don't think you need to restrict your diet. You can follow your regular diet."
3818,820,3219,Do migraine headaches run in the family?
3819,820,3220,Any family history of blood clots?
3820,821,3221,Are you married?
3821,821,3222,Are you working?
3822,821,3223,What is your highest degree?
3823,821,3224,How is your living situation now? Who is taking care of you?
3824,821,3225,Do you smoke? Or drink or have ever used any drugs.
3825,822,3226,"Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?"
3826,822,3227,Do you drink at all?
3827,822,3228,"Any illicit drug use, such as cocaine, marijuana or heroin?"
3828,823,3229,"Hello, miss. How are you doing today? It looks like we are evaluating C O P D and emphysema."
3829,823,3230,It has been quite some time. How are you feeling?
3830,823,3231,I understand the frustration. When you live in a nursing facility you lose a lot of your freedom.
3831,823,3232,In spite of all of that how are your respiratory issues?
3832,823,3233,"Unfortunately, that is the nature of the disease. I am happy to see that the pulmonary disease has not changed significantly since your last visit."
3833,823,3234,Okay. Do you have any fever or chills?
3834,823,3235,Do you experience any chest pains? I want to check especially since you have been coughing up some mucus.
3835,824,3236,"You can continue working, I just want you to be careful."
3836,824,3237,Great.
3837,825,3237,"Can you confirm your age for me, ma'am?"
3838,825,3238,"Great, so what brings you in to see me today?"
3839,825,3239,Have you ever had a cystoscopy?
3840,825,3240,When are your episodes for the most part?
3841,825,3241,Are you having any pain with urination?
3842,825,3242,"Aside from the little bit of blood, can you tell if there's any pus in your urine?"
3843,825,3243,Have you taken any medications for this?
3844,825,3244,"Well, this ultrasound of the kidney is also unremarkable, so at this time I think we should try a different medication."
3845,826,3244,Any health issues on your mom or dad's side?
3846,827,3245,"Hello sir, how are you?"
3847,827,3246,"Hm, don't worry! We will take care of you, let me start by taking some details."
3848,827,3247,So were you referred by someone or-
3849,827,3248,Okay. And what is your age?
3850,827,3249,"Ah, that's clever, you certainly look very young. And which is your dominant hand? Are you left handed, or right?"
3851,827,3250,"So, tell me what is going on with you?"
3852,827,3251,"Well, it's not uncommon."
3853,827,3252,"Oh, okay. What do you do?"
3854,827,3253,"Okay, and when did you notice first that you are forgetting things?"
3855,827,3254,And did it cause any problem at work or any mishaps?
3856,827,3255,"Okay, I have my notes let me put the date, oh what is the date-"
3857,827,3256,Thank you!
3858,828,3256,"All right, you can go home now."
3859,828,3257,You can stay at your friend's place and make sure to take good care of yourself.
3860,828,3258,Make sure you follow up with Doctor X on Monday or Tuesday. I know that Doctor Y already discussed his plans. Continue taking your medicines except Prozac. Okay?
3861,829,3258,Do you smoke or drink?
3862,830,3259,"Hi there! Welcome to the Neurology clinic, sir."
3863,830,3260,What brings you in to the clinic today?
3864,830,3261,What did you notice as far as symptoms?
3865,830,3262,Did the double vision happen more than one time?
3866,830,3263,How long do the episodes last?
3867,830,3264,Did you ever receive any treatment for your binocular diplopia?
3868,830,3265,What eyelid was drooping?
3869,830,3266,What is your dominate hand?
3870,830,3267,And how old are you?
3871,830,3268,"Involving the double vision, does it become worse when looking at distant objects?"
3872,830,3269,When you look at objects off to either side of midline does it become worse?
3873,830,3270,Do you have any other symptoms related to the vision issues?
3874,831,3271,"How old is your son? 
Guest_family: He is almost five and a half years old now."
3875,831,3271,"What seems to be the problem? 
Guest_family: He has a lot of pain about both feet, and if you look at it, it looks like his feet rotate inwards."
3876,831,3271,"Okay, let me see, okay, um, he has rocker bottom feet.  
Guest_family: Okay."
3877,831,3271,"I believe he would benefit from a subtalar arthrodesis, possible autograft, and lengthening of the Achilles. I'll go over the details of that procedure right now. 
Guest_family: Can we do the surgery soon?"
3878,831,3271,"Yes we can. But we'll probably need to do another procedure until his foot matures some more.   This is a stabilizing measure.
Guest_family: What are the risks of infection if we do the surgery?"
3879,831,3271,"Historically, the risk of infection is very low, usually less than one percent. 
Guest_family: How do you get the risk so low?"
3880,831,3271,"We use prophylactic antibiotics to minimize the infection risk. 
Guest_family: Will he be able to walk again right after the surgery?"
3881,831,3271,"No, he'll need to stay off it for a while, we call this nonweightbearing. It will only be for some time after the procedure, it's not permanent.  
Guest_family: What are the rest of the risks?"
3882,831,3271,"The total risks of surgery include risks of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, hardware failure, need for other surgical procedures, need to be nonweightbearing for some time. I would not worry about these risks, though. The risk is low. 
Guest_family: Okay. Let's do the surgery."
3883,832,3271,Welcome back to the clinic.
3884,832,3272,I understand that we are doing an impairment rating exam today.
3885,832,3273,And we are evaluating your right shoulder injury. Correct?
3886,832,3274,Was this a workrelated injury?
3887,832,3275,How did the work injury happen?
3888,832,3276,What is the date of the incident?
3889,832,3277,Are you currently working?
3890,832,3278,"I am required to ask some specific questions for the L and I paperwork. What is your ago, ethnicity and gender?"
3891,832,3279,Have you ever had a prior injury to your right shoulder?
3892,832,3280,Are right or left hand dominant?
3893,832,3281,"Other then your shoulder injury, do you have any other chronic health problems?"
3894,832,3282,"Are you experiencing any fever, chills or illnesses?"
3895,832,3283,Let discuss some of the previous treatments and test that you have been done for your shoulder.
3896,832,3284,What treatments have you done?
3897,832,3285,Did either of those treatments help?
3898,832,3286,Brachial plexopathy?
3899,832,3287,"Oh, I see his notes in your chart. It says that he felt like you had a right superficial radial neuritis and blocked this with resolution of your symptoms. Then it looks like he sent you to get E M G testing at Valley Medical. Let me look for those results."
3900,832,3288,"Here it is. It says that the right suprascapular neuropathy although a C5 radiculopathy could not be ruled out.  MRI testing on the cervical spine was then done which was negative for disk herniation and underwent suprascapular nerve decompression of the scapular notch on December eighteenth, two thousand and three."
3901,832,3289,This has been a long drawn out course of treatments for you.
3902,833,3290,Are you up to date on your vaccines?
3903,834,3291,"Hi there! Welcome in, sir."
3904,834,3292,What is your past medical history?
3905,834,3293,Do you have a primary care doctor?
3906,835,3294,"Are you married, ma'am?"
3907,835,3295,"Do you smoke, use alcohol or use recreational drugs?"
3908,836,3297,"So, everything is okay now?"
3909,837,3298,"So, you were referred by Doctor X."
3910,837,3299,"According to him, I see no changes or correction to your present illness, right?"
3911,838,3300,Do you have any related family history?
3912,838,3301,"Yeah, something like that."
3913,838,3302,How old was he?
3914,839,3303,"So, tell me what's going on? What brings you to the emergency?"
3915,839,3304,When did it start?
3916,839,3305,"Hm, so your blood pressure is one ninety five by eighty three and your heart rate is one twenty one which is quite high."
3917,839,3305,We have started you on I V Metoprolol. This will help to bring your heartrate down.
3918,839,3305,And you said you are sixty six?
3919,839,3306,"I can tell from her reports. Her blood pressure is quite high.
Guest_family: It's been several months since she last took her medicines."
3920,839,3306,"Well, that's not good!"
3921,839,3306,"And does she drink and smoke?
Guest_family: Yes, both."
3922,839,3306,"How much do you drink Ma'am? Is it occasional?
Guest_family: She drinks a lot!"
3923,839,3307,"Well, I think you need to cut down on it."
3924,839,3308,"Hm, I understand. For now I have put you on five M G of Metoprolol and looks like your blood pressure is under control and your heart rate has come down to seventy."
3925,840,3308,"Hello, how are you today?"
3926,840,3309,Have you gotten a mammogram before?
3927,840,3310,That is great. I am happy to see you on top of your preventative healthcare.
3928,841,3311,"Good morning, sir."
3929,841,3312,"So, what seems to be the problem today, sir?"
3930,841,3313,"I see, what about the rest of the lower body, any problems there?"
3931,842,3314,"Do you have a history of any health conditions that I should be aware of, ma'am?"
3932,842,3315,"Oh, wow. Do you have any chronic conditions?"
3933,843,3316,"How have you been handing erectile dysfunction since your last visit, sir?"
3934,843,3317,Have you seen any improvement?
3935,843,3318,Have you had any side effects?
3936,843,3319,"Good, can you describe your erections for me, sir?"
3937,843,3320,"Good, are you having any chest pain?"
3938,843,3321,"Good, are you having any fever or chills?"
3939,843,3322,"Are you having any pain with urination, or blood in the urine?"
3940,843,3323,How often do you urinate during the day?
3941,843,3324,Do you wake up at night to go to the bathroom?
3942,843,3325,"Good, do you have any other conditions that I should know about?"
3943,843,3326,Do you know what that P S A value was?
3944,843,3327,"Thank you, I see here on Doctor X's notes that there were two specimens that were too small to evaluate."
3945,844,3327,"I am afraid, I don't have better news for you, your reports confirm cancer."
3946,844,3328,"I am sorry, I totally understand. Do you want some time?"
3947,844,3329,"Hm, you also have hypertension and diabetes."
3948,844,3330,Did you have any chest pain or shortness of breath or uneasiness?
3949,844,3331,Okay and no dizziness or loss of consciousness or stroke like symptoms?
3950,844,3332,"Okay. Well, your B M I looks fine, that means you are not overweight."
3951,845,3333,Are you married?
3952,845,3334,"Oh, do you smoke?"
3953,845,3335,What about alcohol or any other kind of drug use?
3954,846,3336,Anyone in the family had any medical issues?
3955,846,3337,Can you please elaborate?
3956,847,3338,And you are not allergic to anything right?
3957,847,3339,Any drugs or pollens or anything?
3958,847,3340,Good.
3959,848,3340,"Has the redness worsened over the last few days? 
Guest_clinician: I think so. Her right big toe looks worse to me."
3960,848,3340,"Is she otherwise healthy? 
Guest_clinician: Um besides her toe and some nasal congestion, she's doing fine."
3961,849,3340,You had a surgery on your breasts?
3962,849,3341,"Okay, and what other surgeries have you had?"
3963,849,3342,Okay.
3964,849,3343,Okay. What type of heart surgery did you have?
3965,850,3344,"What happened?
Guest_clinician: She was brought to emergency by her son. Apparently, she is doing fine, no distress. She is alert, and I was able to communicate with her and take her history, she was cooperative and calmy responded to all my questions."
3966,850,3344,"Okay, that's good."
3967,851,3344,What is your family medical history?
3968,851,3345,"Do you have any family history of nervous system disorder or disease such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, or stroke?"
3969,851,3346,"Do you have any children, miss?"
3970,852,3347,Have you ever had any heart problems in the past?
3971,852,3348,"Okay that's fine, I completely understand. We will try to look for your  past medical history."
3972,852,3349,"Yes, type two diabetes. Do you know of any other things that you had in the past?"
3973,852,3350,Okay. And I can see on the file that you have high cholesterol and a gastric ulcer too.
3974,852,3351,Okay. What surgeries have you had in the past?
3975,853,3352,"Good afternoon, ma'am."
3976,853,3353,"So, are you married?"
3977,853,3354,"That's wonderful, um, what do you do for a living?"
3978,853,3355,Do you smoke?
3979,853,3356,Do you drink?
3980,853,3357,How much do you drink every day?
3981,853,3358,"Okay, do you do any illicit drugs?"
3982,853,3359,What do you do for exercise?
3983,853,3360,"Very nice, how often do you exercise?"
3984,854,3361,I'm going to run down a list of symptoms and I'd like you to tell me if you've experienced any.
3985,854,3362,Headache?
3986,854,3363,"Are you coughing at all? And if yes, then are you bringing up any blood with your cough?"
3987,854,3364,Any chest pain or shortness of breath that wakes you in the middle of the night?
3988,854,3365,Do you feel short of breath when you move around?
3989,854,3366,"Any visual, hearing, or swallowing problems?"
3990,854,3367,And finally any changes to your bowel movements or urinary habits?
3991,855,3368,Looking at your medical history now. Any changes since your last visit?
3992,856,3369,"Hello, sir. Looks like we are here for a general wellness check?"
3993,856,3370,"I could not agree more. From your last checkup notes, it looks like you had right knee surgery and back surgery about eighteen months ago. How is that going? Any pain?"
3994,856,3371,What do you do with your new body?
3995,856,3372,"I hope to be as agile as you when I get to retirement. Now let's check the other systems. Do you feel any type of chest pain? Any heaviness, tightness or pressure?"
3996,856,3373,How about shortness of breath?
3997,856,3374,That is decently normal. I get out of breath when walking from floor to floor in this hospital too.
3998,856,3375,"Unfortunately, some things are just with us for life. Do you have any coughing fits or irregular heart beating?"
3999,856,3376,Great! You are getting a clean bill of health from me today. On the notes it says you have Crohn's disease. Are you getting regularly checked for that?
4000,856,3377,Excellent. Are you scheduled for a prostate check?
4001,856,3378,"You are wonderfully on top of it. What a breath of fresh air. From all of your travelling, how are your ankles? Have you noticed any swelling?"
4002,857,3379,And when did you had your last tetanus shot?
4003,857,3380,"Ah, no problem. I see it here in your reports and it's up to date. So that's good."
4004,858,3381,So where do you stay?
4005,858,3382,Alone?
4006,858,3383,"Okay, and do you smoke and drink?"
4007,858,3384,And how much would say you smoke per day?
4008,858,3385,Oh! And for how many years?
4009,858,3386,Hm. And alcohol?
4010,858,3387,Hm.
4011,859,3387,"How are you, sir?"
4012,859,3388,"So, what happened?"
4013,859,3389,"Yeah, his report says he got a hemorrhage, I mean, blood clot in his brain. 
Guest_family: Yeah, after that report they transferred us to this hospital."
4014,860,3389,Is this your first surgery or have you had other surgeries in the past?
4015,861,3390,Where do you work?
4016,861,3391,Do you smoke or consume any form of tobacco?
4017,861,3392,Do you drink or have ever used any illegal drug?
4018,862,3393,Where do you feel the most pain?
4019,862,3394,I see. What kind of shoes do you normally wear to work?
4020,862,3395,Are they cushioned?
4021,862,3396,"I'd advise getting an orthotic for your shoes to help with the heel pain and resting your feet when you're home. In the meantime, I'd like for you to see a specialist to make sure nothing else is going on."
4022,862,3397,"Are you having any other problems? Joint pain, difficulty walking, nausea, vomiting, or other symptoms?"
4023,863,3398,"I'm here to take your social history. So, tell me about yourself."
4024,863,3399,"Right now, you are on methadone, right?"
4025,863,3400,What is your living status?
4026,864,3401,"I will ask you a few questions about your family history, sir."
4027,864,3402,Does anyone in your family ever have any medical problems?
4028,865,3403,Are you aware of any medical issues in your family?
4029,865,3404,What about your paternal family?
4030,865,3405,What about your mom?  Maternal family?
4031,866,3406,"Good morning, sir. Before we begin, how old are you?"
4032,866,3407,"Thank you, and how long have you had this left knee pain?"
4033,866,3408,Is there an injury?
4034,866,3409,What kind of symptoms have you had in this knee since then?
4035,866,3410,Do you feel any instability?
4036,867,3411,I see here that you've been feeling more short of breath.
4037,867,3412,Is it worse when you exert yourself?
4038,867,3413,Did these symptoms start around the same time?
4039,867,3414,Where does your chest feel most congested? And how would you rate the pain right now? Ten being the worst.
4040,867,3415,Does it send pain or numbness or tingling down your arms? How about any jaw pain as a result?
4041,867,3416,Is this your first time experiencing this type of congestion?
4042,867,3417,Did that improve on its own?
4043,867,3418,"You are very strong! You are sixty nine though, so I don't think anyone would see it as weak if you came to the doctor more often."
4044,868,3418,Are you aware of any medical problems in your family?
4045,868,3419,Anyone with any heart disease or diabetes?
4046,869,3420,"Besides pain in your left eye, are you having any other problems?"
4047,869,3421,Do you happen to have a history of eye problems?
4048,870,3422,"Hello, sir how can I help you? Looks like we are talking about snoring today."
4049,870,3423,"Yes, I see on your chart that you were given ten centimeters of H two O nasal pressure and that you predominately suffer from hypopnea. Hypopnea is shallow breathing. How has the device been working?"
4050,870,3424,So what is your sleep pattern now? When do you usually go to bed and wake up?
4051,870,3425,That's some good news. I see you have lost a bit of weight too. Around fifteen to eighteen pounds is something to be proud of.
4052,870,3426,How has work been? Do you think it has been stressful at all?
4053,870,3427,"Yes, I see that you have hay fever. Fatigue is a common symptom from the allergy."
4054,871,3427,How are you feeling today?
4055,871,3428,Anything else?
4056,871,3429,Do you drink?
4057,872,3430,"So, do you smoke?"
4058,872,3431,How about alcohol?
4059,872,3432,"Okay. So, no history of any drug or alcohol abuse, right?"
4060,872,3433,Okay.
4061,873,3433,"Hi, how can I help you?"
4062,873,3434,Oh yes. You are not on Cardizem and your heart rate is up just a little bit today.
4063,873,3435,Okay. Let me see. What symptoms are you experiencing right now?
4064,873,3436,"You are on blood thinners, right? That is Coumadin therapy? Or am I wrong here?"
4065,873,3437,"See, I understand it is hard to control it. It is difficult to regulate that."
4066,873,3438,Okay I will investigate it. Are you experiencing any chest pain or shortness of breath?
4067,873,3439,Okay great!
4068,873,3440,How about your back pain?
4069,873,3441,"Okay, cool."
4070,874,3442,"Good morning, young man."
4071,874,3443,"Who is this young lady, is this your grandmother, or sister?
Guest_family: Oh doctor, yes, I am his grandmother."
4072,874,3443,"Good, my chart says that you're fourteen years old. Is that correct?"
4073,874,3444,"Good, so what seems to be the problem today?"
4074,874,3445,Can you remember a specific injury to this knee?
4075,874,3446,"Do you remember the date of your injury, young man?
Guest_family: Um, it was on December twenty second two thousand seven."
4076,874,3446,"Good, so how have you been treated for this so far?"
4077,874,3447,Have they taken x rays yet?
4078,874,3448,"Let's have a look. Well, you broke your leg."
4079,874,3449,"Right here, this is a tibial tubercule avulsion fracture with patella alta. 
Guest_family: What does that mean, doctor?"
4080,874,3449,"Well, he's broken his leg, and pulled some bone off by doing so. We'll need to do surgery on this.
Guest_family: Oh no, what's the name of the procedure?"
4081,874,3449,"It's called an O R I F. We'll go in there with some hardware to put everything back together, and he can get on the road to healing. 
Guest_family: Let me call his father while we discuss this. What's the risk of infection from this surgery?"
4082,874,3449,"Historically, it's less than one percent. We use antibiotics to control for infection. 
Guest_family: Okay, will he be asleep for this?"
4083,874,3449,"Yes, he won't feel a thing.
Guest_family: That's good too. Will he need this hardware out in the future?"
4084,874,3449,"We can remove everything once he has healed up nicely. Other risks include bleeding, changes in the sensation of the leg, hardware failure, need for post op rehab, need for hardware removal, and failure to restore extensor mechanism tension. But I would not worry about these things. I have been doing these surgeries for years and things like this rarely happen. 
Guest_family: Yes, his father agrees. We're going to do the surgery."
4085,875,3449,"Good afternoon, ma'am. Can you confirm your age for me, please?"
4086,875,3450,"Great, what brings you in for a visit today?"
4087,875,3451,"Is this in your legs, or arms?"
4088,875,3452,I see here that you have sleep apnea too.
4089,875,3453,Why did they do this?
4090,875,3454,Have You had any other treatments?
4091,875,3455,"Thank you, so, how is your leg pain been managed?"
4092,875,3456,Do you have any swelling?
4093,875,3457,How do you sleep with the C P A P?
4094,875,3458,How would you rate your quality of sleep?
4095,876,3459,"Hi there, what's going on?
Guest_family: I am her daughter. I brought her to the emergency. She lives in a skilled nursing home. Today, when I went to meet her, I found her with the right side of her face drooping. I immediately rushed her here."
4096,876,3459,"Oh, you did the right thing. Ma'am, how are you feeling?
Guest_family: She has dementia, most of the time she doesn't even remember me."
4097,876,3459,"Oh, okay.How old is she?
Guest_family: She is eighty three. She also has a history of stroke after which she developed this condition where she knows what she wants to speak but is unable to make the word or sentence."
4098,876,3459,"Oh, I see. She has expressive aphasia, correct? 
Guest_family: Yes, that."
4099,876,3459,"Okay, let me check her. She does have a droop to her right side of the face. Ma'am, do you feel any weakness on the right side of your body?
Guest_family: She says yes."
4100,876,3459,"She had her C T scan earlier today and I have the report. It does not show any acute attack or anything. 
Guest_family: Okay!"
4101,876,3459,"But it does show that she has a new onset of a stroke.
Guest_family: Is there anything to worry?"
4102,876,3459,"I think we need to admit her for observation. We need to monitor her. We will also get her a proper treatment for her urinary infection which is not getting better due to resistance to the oral medicines. 
Guest_family: Yeah, sounds good!"
4103,876,3459,"Yeah, let me talk to the nurse.
Guest_family: Thank you."
4104,877,3459,"Hello, are you translating for the patient today? I am sorry, but I do not speak Spanish. 
Guest_family: Yes doctor."
4105,877,3459,"My chart says this man is fifty two years old, is all of that correct? 
Guest_family: Yes doctor, that's correct."
4106,877,3459,"Good, so, what seems to be the problem today?
Guest_family: He hurt himself a while back when he slipped on a grape while he was at the grocery store."
4107,877,3459,"Oh no, when was this?
Guest_family: It was on October second two thousand eight."
4108,877,3459,"Which knee did he injure?
Guest_family: Doctor, it was his left knee."
4109,877,3459,"How has he been treated for this so far?
Guest_family: He went straight to the E D immediately, and then he saw his P C P."
4110,877,3459,"What did the P C P recommend?
Guest_family: He only referred him to P T, and gave him a knee brace."
4111,878,3459,Do you smoke cigarettes?
4112,878,3460,Do you drink alcohol or use recreational drugs?
4113,878,3461,What do you do for work?
4114,879,3462,Have you had any adverse reactions to medications you've taken in the past?
4115,880,3463,Are you okay?
4116,880,3464,I am asking this as you look a little pale.
4117,880,3465,Okay that won't be something we can't fix.
4118,880,3466,"Yes, I do not see any issues with your past history."
4119,881,3467,"Hello today I have my assistant with me, and she will be representing your case. Tell me who do we have today? 
Guest_clinician: Patient has been cared by Doctor X since two thousand and two. She had a Codman Hakim shunt set at ninety M M H two O. She last came to our clinic in January two thousand and eight. At that time, she was recommended to follow up with Doctor Y for the medical management of her chronic headaches. She was also recommended to see a psychiatrist for her depression."
4120,881,3467,Did you go and see a psychiatrist?
4121,881,3468,What brings you here today?
4122,881,3469,"When did she have her scan? 
Guest_clinician: She had her stunt adjusted which was after the M R I on April eighteenth."
4123,881,3470,Are you able to sleep in the night properly?
4124,881,3471,Is there anything that elevates this pain? Or decreases it?
4125,881,3472,Is it like specific to any particular area of your head?
4126,881,3473,Is there any nausea associated with the headaches?
4127,881,3474,Anything else that happens along with these headaches?
4128,881,3475,Any changes in your vision?
4129,881,3476,Any other thing you want to add?
4130,882,3477,Tell me about the medical issues you had in the past or still do.
4131,882,3478,"Wow, okay. Any known allergies?"
4132,883,3479,Any known allergies?
4133,884,3480,"Hello there, how are you doing?"
4134,884,3481,"Don't worry, I will check you up. We will figure it out. Do you remember when you had your last physical?"
4135,884,3482,"Okay, I'm going through your chart. It looks like you have not been feeling well for about two weeks now."
4136,884,3483,Tell me what is happening exactly.
4137,884,3484,What are you experiencing exactly? What are your symptoms?
4138,884,3485,Were you feeling tired or fatigued?
4139,884,3486,What else are you feeling?
4140,884,3487,Have you noticed anything that you are doing or anything else that kind of increasing these symptoms?
4141,884,3488,Is it the same when you are doing a lot of physical stuff like physical activities or something like that?
4142,884,3489,Do you have any history of any heart issues in the past?
4143,884,3490,Okay. What did you do that time? How did you recover?
4144,884,3491,Do you remember what they gave you? Like name or anything of the medicine.
4145,884,3492,Anything else going on?
4146,884,3493,Have you seen any color change in your bowel movements?
4147,884,3494,Have you ever noticed blood in the stools?
4148,884,3495,Is there any pain in your tummy?
4149,884,3496,How's your appetite?
4150,884,3497,Do you smoke?
4151,885,3498,"So just to double check, you're not on any medications?"
4152,886,3499,What brings you in today?
4153,886,3500,Are you bringing anything up when you cough?
4154,886,3501,"Are you having any other symptoms, such as chest pain, headaches, nausea, or vomiting?"
4155,886,3502,Are you taking anything for the cough or stuffy nose?
4156,886,3503,Okay. Let's take a look at you. Hm it appears that you have a U R I.
4157,887,3503,"How are you feeling today, sir?"
4158,887,3504,I reviewed the chart notes that was sent to me by the nursing home. They also sent me your medical history. You have been going through a lot recently.
4159,887,3505,I understand that you had a seizer and that is why you were taken to the hospital.
4160,887,3506,Okay so you are having some partial weakness on this side?
4161,887,3507,I am going to try to help you get back to doing things on your own.
4162,887,3508,Okay. I see here in the chart that you had two surgeries on July sixth.
4163,887,3509,Oh yes. On August seventh.
4164,887,3510,Your surgeries may have been the reason for the C diff.
4165,887,3511,"It is an infection in the large intestine. It is often caused by overuse of antibiotics, and you have been on them for a while due to the surgeries that you have had. Or it could be from the surgery itself."
4166,888,3512,How is your sleep? Are you sleeping well?
4167,888,3513,Good. Any mood swings or did you feel your emotions are out of control?
4168,888,3514,"Any depression like feeling, sudden mood changes or feeling sad or hopeless?"
4169,888,3515,Okay.
4170,889,3515,"How's he doing today? 
Guest_family: I think he might have fifth disease with sinusitis. It's been running rampant at his school."
4171,889,3515,"Oh, wow. Let's see what we can do."
4172,890,3516,"Yes, what's wrong? Where's your pain?"
4173,890,3517,When did it start?
4174,890,3518,Yes?
4175,891,3519,"Just want to ask you few routine questions, let me know if any of this is positive."
4176,891,3520,"Do you have any problems like headache, fever, rash, oral ulcer?"
4177,891,3521,Any problem with vision? Like unable to see or double vision?
4178,891,3522,"Okay. Do you get palpitations, like are you aware of your own heart?"
4179,891,3523,How about breathlessness while lying down or do you have to get up in the middle of the night to catch a breath?
4180,891,3524,"That's great. Any diarrhea, constipation, or red blood come out in stool? Or pale stool? Like any change in the color of stool?"
4181,891,3525,Okay. Any jaundice recently?
4182,891,3526,Do you have problems with appetite?
4183,891,3527,Because of that have you noticed any weight loss?
4184,891,3528,Okay sounds good.
4185,892,3529,"Good morning, ma'am. What seems to be the problem with your knee?"
4186,892,3530,How old are you now?
4187,892,3531,What kind of symptoms have you had since the fall?
4188,892,3532,Has this knee given out before?
4189,892,3533,Is there any swelling in this knee?
4190,892,3534,What kind of treatments have you had for this knee?
4191,892,3535,Have you had surgery on this knee in the past?
4192,893,3536,"How're you doing today, sir?"
4193,893,3537,I see that you've recently celebrated your seventy second birthday.
4194,893,3538,"Aw surprises are always fun. However, I'm sorry to hear that you're not doing that well today."
4195,893,3539,Is this new for you?
4196,893,3540,Do you remember losing consciousness during any of those episodes?
4197,893,3541,I see. Do you experience room spinning dizziness at all?
4198,893,3542,Are you right or left handed?
4199,893,3543,"And besides what you've mentioned to me so far, no other symptoms of concern?"
4200,894,3544,And where do you live?
4201,894,3545,"Ah, I see. And do you have lot of friends there?"
4202,894,3546,"Okay, and do you drink?"
4203,894,3547,How about smoking?
4204,895,3548,How are you feeling?
4205,895,3549,"What happened last night? 
Guest_family: She went out to a party last night. She came home drunk and high."
4206,895,3549,What did you take?
4207,895,3550,How much Ecstasy did you take?
4208,895,3551,What time did you start taking the tablets?
4209,895,3552,"Mom, did you notice any blood, or any yellow or green color in the vomit? 
Guest_family:  No."
4210,895,3552,Are you still feeling nauseous?
4211,895,3553,Are you experiencing any pain at all?
4212,895,3554,Did you or do you feel depressed?
4213,895,3555,Do you or have you ever had suicidal thoughts?
4214,895,3556,Are you seeing or hearing things that are not real?
4215,895,3557,Do you or have you ever had thoughts of harming yourself?
4216,895,3558,Just one more question. Prior to last night have you had any recent illnesses or injuries?
4217,896,3559,Do you have any support system?
4218,896,3560,Okay so live alone at home?
4219,896,3561,Do you smoke or drink?
4220,897,3562,"So, are you married?"
4221,897,3563,"Okay, and do you have someone who is managing your case?"
4222,897,3564,Do you smoke or drink?
4223,898,3565,Have you ever had surgery?
4224,898,3566,"No gallbladder or appendix removal, c sections, or joint replacements?"
4225,899,3567,"I just need to confirm a few pieces of information from my nurse before we begin today, sir."
4226,899,3568,"Great, so it says here that you are forty five years old, and you identify as Caucasian. Is that correct?"
4227,899,3569,"Thank you, so, what seems to be the problem today?"
4228,899,3570,Where is your pain?
4229,899,3571,Is there an injury associated with this pain?
4230,900,3572,"Good morning, sir. Can you confirm your age for me, please?"
4231,900,3573,"Great, and which hand is your dominant hand?"
4232,900,3574,"Great, thank you. So, what seems to be the problem today?"
4233,900,3575,Have you been treated for this so far?
4234,900,3576,What did they tell you there?
4235,900,3577,"Can you describe your symptoms for me, please?"
4236,900,3578,"I'm going to apply some pressure right here at the nipple line, can you feel that?"
4237,900,3579,Have you had any weakness in your legs?
4238,900,3580,Is it getting worse?
4239,900,3581,When did you start using the cane?
4240,900,3582,Why did you begin using it?
4241,900,3583,Are you able to stand without it?
4242,900,3584,Have you had any loss of bowel or bladder control?
4243,900,3585,When was the last time you urinated?
4244,900,3586,"In addition to the numbness, how else would you describe your leg symptoms?"
4245,900,3587,Do you have any back or neck pain?
4246,900,3588,Do you have any shortness of breath?
4247,900,3589,Have you had any lightheadedness or feelings of faint?
4248,900,3590,How long have you had that feeling?
4249,901,3591,Do you have any known allergies to medications?
4250,902,3592,"Good evening, and welcome to A B C D General Hospital E D."
4251,902,3593,"Before we begin, how old are you? And which gender do you identify?"
4252,902,3594,"Thank you, what happened?"
4253,902,3595,How far did you fall?
4254,902,3596,"Oh, yes, I see. I have some good news for you, there's no gross deformity in this ankle."
4255,902,3597,"I don't see any ankle dislocation, which is good."
4256,902,3598,Have you had your x rays taken yet?
4257,902,3599,"Great, let me pull them up here. Okay, um, if you look here, you'll see a fracture of your talus."
4258,902,3600,"That's your heel, to be specific, it's a grade I V Hawkins fracture of the left talus. You are still neurovascularly intact in the distal region."
4259,902,3601,"Do you have any other pain from the fall, aside from the ankle?"
4260,902,3602,"Okay, I think we should do surgery in order to repair this ankle."
4261,902,3603,"There is very weak blood flow to the body of this bone, there's a risk for avascular necrosis, which is bone death."
4262,902,3604,"Overall, the risks of infection are less than one percent. We'll use antibiotics to keep everything clean."
4263,902,3605,"Yes, you'll be under anesthesia."
4264,903,3606,What medications are you currently taking?
4265,904,3607,Did you ever have any surgery?
4266,905,3608,"Hello, miss. How are you doing today?"
4267,905,3609,I see. Do migraines usually run in your family?
4268,905,3610,"Oh, wow. I'm looking at your blood reports, and it shows you have high blood sugar. Does diabetes run in your family too?"
4269,906,3611,What's bringing you in today?
4270,906,3612,Where are you experiencing the most pain? And when did this pain start?
4271,906,3613,That doesn't sound the least bit comfortable. Let's get you feeling better. Do you think it's related to your tooth?
4272,906,3614,I see. When was the last time you visited the dentist?
4273,906,3615,Have you noticed any facial swelling since all of this started?
4274,906,3616,"Any headaches, throat swelling, sore throat, difficulty swallowing or chewing?"
4275,906,3617,"How about any neck pain, swollen lymph nodes, chills, fever, or other symptoms?"
4276,907,3618,"How long has your finger been in pain, sir?"
4277,907,3619,Have you seen another doctor for this pain?
4278,907,3620,Do you have the records from the visit?
4279,907,3621,"Okay, so I see you have a trigger finger, and a mucous cyst, and this other doctor gave you injections. Is that correct?"
4280,907,3622,Did the injections help at all?
4281,907,3623,"So, your finger is still locking today?"
4282,908,3624,"Hello, I am Doctor James.
Guest_family: Hi Doctor, this is my daughter Miya, and I am Jena."
4283,908,3624,"Nice to meet you ladies. So, Miya how old are you?"
4284,908,3625,"Okay, so tell me what is going on with you?"
4285,908,3626,Oh wow. Can you tell me where exactly the pain is?
4286,908,3627,I see. Did you get hurt or bump your head?
4287,908,3628,"Does she have any history of headaches?
Guest_family: No."
4288,908,3628,"Okay, any nausea or vomiting?"
4289,908,3629,"Hm, are you able to see properly though, any change in your vision?"
4290,908,3630,Any fever?
4291,908,3631,Okay.
4292,909,3631,"And you said you're right handed, correct?"
4293,909,3632,"Okay, great. I've made note of it in your chart. I have one more question to ask regarding tobacco and alcohol. Do you smoke or drink?"
4294,910,3633,"He's here for sepsis and I suspect he may have spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. 
Guest_clinician: Let me pull up his chart."
4295,911,3633,"Let's check your throat. Okay, I don't see any swelling or any mass. Is there any pain when I touch you?"
4296,911,3634,I don't feel any kind of lump in your throat. That is a good sign. It looks very flexible and symmetric.
4297,912,3635,"Remind me, please, how old are you?"
4298,912,3636,"Thank you, what seems to be the problem today?"
4299,912,3637,Is the pain messing with your ability to do activities?
4300,912,3638,What kind of treatments have you had so far?
4301,912,3639,Do you remember what kind of injections you've had?
4302,912,3640,Did these relieve the pain at all?
4303,912,3641,"Well, there is surgery for this."
4304,912,3642,"Historically, it's less than one percent."
4305,912,3643,We use prophylactic antibiotics in order to eliminate the risk.
4306,912,3644,"There's a risk, but it's low. Other risks are pulmonary embolism, need for further surgery, and further pain."
4307,913,3645,"How's this little guy doing today? 
Guest_family: I think he might have another ear infection."
4308,913,3645,"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Let's have a look see.  
Guest_family: He's been telling me over and over again that his left ear is hurting him. He was here on April fourteenth and prescribed Amoxicillin."
4309,913,3645,"Did that seem to help? 
Guest_family: It did at first, but the pain is back again."
4310,913,3645,"Has he been running any fevers? 
Guest_family: No, no fevers."
4311,913,3645,"He sounds a bit congested. 
Guest_family: He is. When he blows his nose, he brings up really thick mucous. This never really went away even with antibiotics. He's also been coughing a fair amount."
4312,913,3645,"Is his cough productive? 
Guest_family: Yeah."
4313,913,3645,"Does it seem to be keeping him up at night? How does the mucous look?
Guest_family: No, I don't think so. It is pretty thick and viscous. The cough isn't constant or anything."
4314,913,3645,"And no shortness of breath or wheezing that you've noticed? 
Guest_family: No."
4315,914,3645,"How are you feeling today, sir?"
4316,914,3646,How is your strength and muscular pain?
4317,914,3647,Do you have any other complaints today?
4318,915,3648,"You have cholesterol issues, right?"
4319,915,3649,Okay. I see. Gemfibrozil? That sounds familiar? Do you take that?
4320,915,3650,Okay. Do you remember taking them at all as an outpatient?
4321,915,3651,Okay don't worry I can look at your previous records. We do have them.
4322,916,3651,Are you taking any medicine?
4323,917,3652,So it looks like you're here today for a noticeable foreign body sensation in your eye.
4324,917,3653,First time for everything I guess! When did you first notice the sensation?
4325,917,3654,"Okay. Hm, are you experiencing any eye pain, blurred vision, or sensitivity to light?"
4326,918,3655,What brings you in today?
4327,918,3656,When did it start?
4328,918,3657,Have you noticed any abnormal discharge?
4329,918,3658,"Any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting?"
4330,918,3659,Near your pelvis?
4331,918,3660,Have you started any new lotions or products?
4332,918,3661,Have you tried anything for the pain or itching?
4333,918,3662,"If it's okay with you, I'd like to do a pelvic exam."
4334,918,3663,Have you been sexually active prior to or after noticing these concerns?
4335,918,3664,"I see. You may have an infection, which is why I'd also like to send out samples to the lab. Did you use protection?"
4336,918,3665,We can look into that as well. Hang tight while I grab the nurse for the pelvic exam.
4337,919,3665,Do you have any allergies?
4338,919,3666,Okay so no medically relevant allergies then. Nothing?
4339,920,3667,I don't think we need to do any major procedure right now.
4340,921,3668,Did you have any medical issues?
4341,922,3669,Any known allergies?
4342,922,3670,Let me add that to your record.
4343,923,3670,So how are you feeling?
4344,923,3671,Any illness or fever?
4345,923,3672,Any headache or nausea?
4346,923,3673,Any vomiting or stomach upset?
4347,923,3674,"Okay, any numbness tingling or loss of sensation in the hand?"
4348,923,3675,Otherwise feeling well?
4349,924,3676,Welcome to the clinic. I am Doctor Frank.
4350,924,3677,What brings you into see me today?
4351,924,3678,What happened to make you think that you had a stroke?
4352,924,3679,Did you lose consciousness?
4353,924,3680,Did the dizzy episode happen after you woke up this morning?
4354,924,3681,Has anything like this happen to you in the past?
4355,924,3682,Did you have any other symptoms like you did this morning?
4356,924,3683,Did you see a doctor after the fall you had three weeks ago?
4357,924,3684,Have you had any cold or any other resent illnesses?
4358,924,3685,Okay. How old are you?
4359,924,3686,Fantastic.
4360,925,3686,What is your family medical history?
4361,925,3687,Do you have siblings?
4362,926,3688,Do you have any known drug allergies?
4363,927,3689,Any history of heart attack?
4364,927,3690,"Any chest pain, palpitations or shortness of breath on exertion?"
4365,927,3691,How about your blood pressure?
4366,927,3692,Any swelling?
4367,927,3693,Any history of irregular heartbeats?
4368,928,3694,"Hi, do you smoke?"
4369,928,3695,Do you take any drugs?
4370,928,3696,What about drinks? Do you take alcohol in any form?
4371,929,3697,"Hi there, so you are here for your follow up?"
4372,929,3698,"Okay, let me quickly check your discharge sheet."
4373,929,3699,It says you had multiple extensive subcutaneous abscesses on your right thigh and there was a massive open wound as well.
4374,929,3700,"Okay, and then they did multiple abscesses excisions on your thigh."
4375,929,3701,Okay.
4376,930,3701,"Hi Gina, how are you?"
4377,930,3702,"I understand. So, you are here for your follow up post your surgeries, right?"
4378,930,3703,"Alright, I see you recently had your left breast removed due to cancer."
4379,930,3704,"And then you also had your right knee replaced due to arthritis in your kneecap, right?"
4380,930,3705,Hm.
4381,931,3705,"Hello. How are you all doing today? 
Guest_family: We're doing fine. I'm the mother of my four year old boy."
4382,931,3705,"Hello, ma'am. What seems to be the problem?
Gest_family: We just wanted to follow up after my son's E R visit."
4383,931,3705,"Oh, no. What happened?
Guest_family: He was playing at the park and thought it was a good idea to jump off the swing. Crazy kid, right?"
4384,931,3705,"It happens. Live and you learn, as they say. Do you have any information from the E R visit.
Guest_family: I gave it to the nurse. Did you not get it?
Guest_clinician: Sorry. I got really busy, but here is the report."
4385,931,3705,"Could you read it to me, please?
Guest_clinician: Of course. So, their son severely injured his left distal humerus. No problems were claimed before the injury. The E R saw him for his deformed elbow."
4386,931,3705,"Are there any exams on the report? 
Guest_clinician: There is an x ray and physical exam. They both confirmed a closed type three supracondylar fracture of his left distal humerus with severe puckering of the skin anteriorly with major ecchymosis in the same region. He did have a radial pulse palpable"
4387,931,3705,"Thank you, nurse. Mom, were you there before his surgery? 
Guest_family: My husband and I were. My husband rushed from this cultural event he had planned."
4388,931,3705,"I see. What do you all identify as?
Guest_family: We identify as white."
4389,931,3705,I see. I'm going to perform a neurological exam on your son now. Hi buddy. Is it fine if I do a quick exam?
4390,931,3706,Thanks. It'll be quick.
4391,931,3707,"After doing the exam I see his ulnar, median, and radial nerves are intact. I couldn't do the entire exam because the pain might be too much for him.
Guest_family: Thank you so much for your help."
4392,932,3707,You had a heart procedure done couple months back right?
4393,932,3708,Okay.
4394,932,3709,"Yes, I saw, you are on Coumadin. Do you know other medications you are on?"
4395,932,3710,Wow! That is great. Thank you for being so thorough.
4396,932,3711,"So you are on Pacerone, Zaroxolyn, albuterol inhaler, Neurontin, Lasix, and some other."
4397,932,3712,Do you have diabetes?
4398,932,3713,"Okay, have you smoked in the past?"
4399,932,3714,Okay. Have you ever had lung problems?
4400,932,3715,Okay. How about your family? Anyone sick?
4401,933,3716,What is your family medical history?
4402,934,3717,What is your family medical history?
4403,934,3718,Do you have any siblings?
4404,935,3719,"Hello, how are you?"
4405,935,3720,"How are you related to the patient? 
Guest_family: Hello doctor, I am his son."
4406,935,3720,"Hello. How old is he?
Guest_family: He is eighty years old. He is suffering from dementia."
4407,935,3720,"I see. Do you think he will be able to provide me with his medical history?
Guest_family: I don't think so. Sometimes he even forgets his name."
4408,935,3721,"I don't blame you. I forget my things at my age.
Guest_family: Yeah, it is something like episodic that he forgets everything and sometimes he's absolutely normal. On good days, he's very nice to talk to."
4409,935,3721,"What is his living status?
Guest_family: He lives at a board and care. It is a cozier homelike place."
4410,935,3721,"That's good. So what brings you here in the emergency today?
Guest_family: He started complaining of stomach aches. Luckily, I was there. It was very sudden at one moment he was talking to me nicely and then all of a sudden he started complaining of severe pain in his stomach area. That's when I decided to bring him here in the emergency room."
4411,935,3721,Do you have any previous reports?
4412,935,3722,Do you remember when was this scan done?
4413,935,3723,Do you remember of any medical issues before?
4414,935,3724,"Okay, let me see what your scan says. I am reading the C T Scan report provided by the patient. It states that patient has dilated bladder with thick wall suggesting an outlet obstruction as well as bilateral hydronephrosis and hydroureter."
4415,935,3725,"I see that you have already been given some I V fluid along with antibiotics by the emergency room doctor. 
Guest_family: Yeah."
4416,935,3725,"Did he ever complain of pain during urination or nausea and vomiting?
Guest_family: Yes, he had fever a few days back. When we asked him about other symptoms, he said, it's hard to urinate and it is painful. Nausea and vomiting are something that I am not sure about. He was normally rushing to the restroom and every time used to say he didn't want to pee as it hurt him. He also had a few accidents in the last few days where he wet himself."
4417,935,3725,Thank you for providing me with all his history. It will be very helpful for me to treat him now.
4418,936,3725,What is your family medical history?
4419,937,3726,How are your parents doing?
4420,937,3727,"Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that."
4421,938,3728,What's going on?
4422,938,3729,Since when?
4423,938,3730,Okay.
4424,939,3731,"So, you are following up for your high blood pressure and high cholesterol?"
4425,940,3732,"Hey, what's going on with you today?"
4426,940,3733,You have fever too?
4427,941,3734,"Hi, how are you?"
4428,941,3735,What happened and how long since it started?
4429,941,3736,"Oh, I see. Let me try and see if she can answer few questions
Guest_family: Sure."
4430,941,3736,Did you have any nausea or vomiting?
4431,942,3737,Any past medical history I should be aware of?
4432,943,3738,Do you have allergies to any medications?
4433,943,3739,What happens when you take Clonidine?
4434,943,3740,And how about with Medifast?
4435,944,3741,"Good morning, ma'am. My nurses tell me that you're thirty nine years old, is that correct?"
4436,944,3742,"So, what seems to be the problem today, ma'am?"
4437,944,3743,Do you remember the mechanism of injury to this knee?
4438,944,3744,"Well, was it a twisting, pulling, snapping kind of injury?"
4439,944,3745,"Okay, have you seen another doctor for this?"
4440,944,3746,Can I see the report?
4441,944,3747,This M R I shows an A C L tear. Do you have any instability in this knee?
4442,944,3748,Have there been any dislocations?
4443,944,3749,"Well, there's surgery to fix this. I can repair that A C L."
4444,944,3750,"Historically, it's less than one percent. We use antibiotics to control for infection."
4445,944,3751,"Yes, you won't feel a thing."
4446,945,3752,"Can you tell me more about your family history, ma'am? How is your father doing?"
4447,945,3753,I'm so sorry to hear that. What about your mother? How is she doing?
4448,945,3754,"I'm sorry, ma'am."
4449,945,3755,Do you have any siblings?
4450,945,3756,"That's a big family, do they have any conditions that you know about?"
4451,945,3757,"Okay, thank you. Do you have any children?"
4452,945,3758,That's great. Do you have any other conditions I should know about?
4453,946,3759,Anyone sick at home?
4454,947,3760,Hi there! What brings you in today?
4455,947,3761,Have you had any other symptoms?
4456,947,3762,Have you been staying hydrated?
4457,947,3763,Lets get a urine sample. I will have the nurse come in with a sample cup.
4458,948,3764,"Good afternoon, sir."
4459,948,3765,"You're forty four, correct?"
4460,948,3766,"Great, what seems to be the problem today, sir?"
4461,948,3767,Does the pain go into your legs?
4462,948,3768,Is there an injury associated with this pain?
4463,948,3769,Do you have any paperwork or medical records from the initial injury?
4464,948,3770,"What do you do for a living, sir?"
4465,948,3771,"Your pain came back while working there, correct?"
4466,948,3772,Do you remember when your last appointment here was?
4467,948,3773,"With ten being the worst pain imaginable, what was your pain out of ten at your last visit?"
4468,948,3774,Have you taken any medicine for this?
4469,948,3775,How did your pain respond to the Dosepak?
4470,948,3776,"Can you point to me where the pain is, sir?"
4471,948,3777,This band right here?
4472,948,3778,"Okay, this is between your L four and sacrum. How would you describe your right leg pain?"
4473,948,3779,Have you ever had back surgery?
4474,948,3780,Do you know where the focus was?
4475,948,3781,Have you had any imaging done on the lower back?
4476,948,3782,"Okay, this shows multi level degenerative changes, with facet involvement at L two L three, L three L four, and L five S1, with no neural impingement, which is good."
4477,948,3783,"In summary, you have a significant amount of arthritis in the back."
4478,948,3784,"Okay, this shows severe spinal stenosis at L three L four, but it may have been artifact."
4479,948,3785,This finding may be a misinterpretation.
4480,949,3785,Did you have an allergic reactions to any medication?
4481,949,3786,Okay.
4482,950,3786,"Hello, how are you?"
4483,950,3787,Are there any changes from the last visit in your social history or medical history?
4484,951,3788,Do you take any meds?
4485,951,3789,Are you sure?
4486,952,3790,Did you have any surgeries in the past?
4487,953,3791,Welcome to the clinic.
4488,953,3792,I would like to start with your medical history. Do you have any medical problems or conditions?
4489,953,3793,Yes. Doctor Hanine sent over your recent blood test results and chart notes. Did he discuss those results with you?
4490,953,3794,Yes. The I G G levels show that the subtype is multiple myeloma.
4491,954,3795,"So, how are feeling?"
4492,954,3795,You came here last time with C V A right?
4493,954,3796,"Oh yeah, you have diabetes mellitus. Did you happen to get a blood test done before this visit?"
4494,955,3797,What is your family medical history?
4495,956,3798,What brings you here today?
4496,956,3799,Anything else?
4497,957,3800,Do you smoke?
4498,957,3801,"On average, how many cigarettes would you say you smoke?"
4499,957,3802,Any medical problems that run in the family?
4500,957,3803,How old was he?
4501,957,3804,"Oh wow, how's he doing?"
4502,957,3805,Does anyone else in your family have heart problems?
4503,958,3806,"Hello, miss. How are you doing?"
4504,958,3807,"Okay, great. That's something we can handle today. Can you tell me about your familial history? This will help me see any possible ailments that we should watch out for."
4505,958,3808,How about your father? Your paperwork says both parents are deceased.
4506,958,3809,Your family seems to have a history of ischemic cardiac disease. How are your siblings? The paperwork says you have brothers.
4507,959,3810,Smoke or drink?
4508,960,3811,Are you allergic to anything?
4509,960,3812,How about food allergies.
4510,960,3813,Okay.
4511,961,3813,Do you have any food allergies?
4512,961,3814,Any drug allergies?
4513,962,3815,Do you smoke?
4514,962,3816,How about cigarettes?
4515,962,3817,Good to keep it that way.
4516,963,3817,"Hello! Who do we have here today?
Guest_family: Hello, this is our son, A B C."
4517,963,3817,"How old is he? What is the issue?
Guest_family: He is two. He is continuously complaining of pain in his belly and back. He is active otherwise."
4518,963,3817,"Did you notice any change in his toilet habits or routine?
Guest_family: No."
4519,963,3817,"Any fever or chills or any other issue?
Guest_family: No, we did not notice any such issues, he has been active and was acting very normal otherwise."
4520,963,3817,"Any change in his eating habits?
Guest_family: No, he has been eating and drinking as usual. He was acting normally but we did notice a foul odor coming from his nose. He was on antibiotics after removal of that piece of cotton from his right side of nose in our previous visit here."
4521,963,3817,"How is his nose now?
Guest_family: He got better but now we can notice that odor from his nose again.
Guest_family: His mother started him on the antibiotics again, whatever was remaining, we think something is still there."
4522,963,3817,"Okay, Is there anything else like runny nose or any pain in his ear or bad throat? How about cough or congestion? Or any other issues you have noticed?
Guest_family: No, nothing of those instead he has been active and eating and drinking normally, no other issue."
4523,963,3817,"Is he complaining of any pain or discomfort on bowel movements? Is there any increase in the frequency of urination?
Guest_family: Well, we can't say it for sure as he still wears diapers but we have not noticed anything abnormal."
4524,964,3817,Can you tell me about the medications that you are currently using?
4525,964,3818,"Do you know its strength? Um, like how many milligrams?"
4526,964,3819,When did you start it?
4527,964,3820,Who prescribed it?
4528,965,3821,What type of surgeries have you had in the past?
4529,965,3822,"It's okay, I know. It is Lap Band."
4530,965,3823,Okay great.
4531,966,3824,"Please, tell me a little more about your son. 
Guest_family: Well, he's twelve years old now, but he was born at about a month and a half early."
4532,966,3824,"Were there any other complications with the pregnancy? 
Guest_family: He was exposed to drugs in the womb while I was pregnant, and he has been diagnosed with autism."
4533,966,3824,"Okay. I see he has previously had an operation on the right knee, can you tell me more about that? 
Guest_family: He previously had a lot of trouble straightening out both of his legs, and since the right was worse than the left he had an operation on the inside part of the back of that leg."
4534,966,3824,"When was this operation? 
Guest_family: It was in February of two thousand seven."
4535,966,3824,"How did he respond to the operation? 
Guest_family: He responded really well, he was walking much better, and even got back to playing sports with the other kids in the neighborhood."
4536,966,3824,"What seems to be the problem today? 
Guest_family: Now, his left knee is getting really bad, it's like how the right knee was. He can't straighten this leg. I think we should do the same operation again on the left knee."
4537,966,3824,"Yes, I think we'll have to do surgery. 
Guest_family: What is the risk of infection with the surgery?"
4538,966,3824,"Historically, it's been less than one percent, we use prophylactic antibiotics in order to minimize infection risk. 
Guest_family: Will he be under anesthesia for the procedure?"
4539,966,3824,"Yes, he will be. He won't feel anything. 
Guest_family: Will this completely solve his problem?"
4540,966,3824,"I can't guarantee that he won't need additional procedures in the future. The other risks include, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion to the leg, failure to restore normal anatomy, and risk it won't work in general. 
Guest_family: What's the name of this procedure?"
4541,966,3824,"It's called a distal medial hamstring release.
Guest_family: This is the same procedure he had in two thousand seven, right?"
4542,966,3824,"Yes ma'am, the exact same one.  
Guest_family: Okay, that sounds good, we want to go through with the procedure."
4543,966,3824,"Okay, here is my surgical scheduler's business card, give them a call, and they can walk you through everything."
4544,967,3825,I'm sorry to hear that. We'll get to the bottom of it.
4545,967,3826,When did you first start noticing this?
4546,967,3827,Any chest pain or tightness with the shortness of breath?
4547,967,3828,"Any fever, chills, or sweats?"
4548,967,3829,Any cough or coughing up blood?
4549,967,3830,How about wheezing or swelling in your legs?
4550,968,3831,"Can you tell me more about your family medical history, sir? How's your dad doing?"
4551,968,3832,"I'm so sorry to hear that, sir. How is your mother?"
4552,968,3833,"I'm sorry, that must be so hard."
4553,969,3834,"Good afternoon, who's the victim today, sir? Is it you, or your daughter? 
Guest_family: Good afternoon, doctor. It's my daughter today."
4554,969,3834,"Remind me, how old is she?"
4555,969,3835,"So, what happened? My nurses tell me she fell today."
4556,969,3836,"Where does it hurt, young lady?"
4557,969,3837,Which hand do you write with?
4558,969,3838,"Before seeing me, have you seen anyone else?
Guest_family: Yeah, we went to an Urgent Care and she had an x ray there."
4559,969,3838,"What else did they do?
Guest_family: They said her arm was broken, and they tried to do a reduction."
4560,969,3838,"Do you have those x rays with you right now?
Guest_family: Yeah, I have them right here, take a look, please."
4561,969,3838,"Well, these x rays show an incarcerated medial epicondyle fracture, as well as a mildly angulated radial shaft break."
4562,969,3839,"Well, in short, you broke the inside part of your elbow. In addition to the pain, do you have any burning or tingling feelings in that arm?"
4563,969,3840,Did you have this before they tried to do a reduction?
4564,969,3841,Is this feeling getting worse?
4565,969,3842,"Okay, guys, there is a lot of pressure on that ulnar nerve because of the break and the attempted reduction. 
Guest_family: What should we do?"
4566,969,3842,"We need to do an O R I F procedure A S A P. I'll reduce that radial shaft fracture at the same time.
Guest_family: O R I F? What's that"
4567,969,3842,"I'll put some pins in the elbow, in order to stabilize the break, and we can start the healing process. 
Guest_family: Will this not heal on its own?"
4568,969,3842,"No, we need to do the surgery. 
Guest_family: Okay, what are the risks of infection with the surgery?"
4569,969,3842,"Historically, its less than one percent. 
Guest_family: How is this possible?"
4570,969,3842,"We use prophylactic antibiotics, this helps us control for infection the entire time. 
Guest_family: Will she be asleep for this?"
4571,969,3842,"Yes, she won't feel a thing. 
Guest_family: Will she need this hardware taken out in the future?"
4572,969,3842,"Yes, in about a year or two, after everything is healed up nicely. The other risks include bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, and hardware failure. I see good results from my surgeries so I would not worry about these things, but I must disclose.
Guest_family: Okay, yes, we'd like to do the surgery."
4573,970,3842,"So, tell me did anyone in your family have Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis?"
4574,970,3843,"Oh, sorry to hear that."
4575,970,3844,Anything else that he or any other family member might have.
4576,970,3845,"Hm, I see."
4577,970,3845,Anything else?
4578,971,3846,How are you today?
4579,971,3847,Do you have any medical conditions?
4580,971,3848,When were you diagnosed with diabetes?
4581,971,3849,Okay.
4582,972,3849,I do not feel any swellings in your neck or groin area.
4583,972,3850,"Okay yeah, I was just trying to look for any lymph nodes."
4584,972,3851,Let me check.
4585,973,3852,Your bloodwork came back from the Coumadin sensitivity test. The results showed a high level of sensitivity. I am going to adjust your dosage of Coumadin to a much lower dose. This will help reduce the bruising and the bleeding episodes. Do you have any questions?
4586,974,3853,"Hello. You must be his mom.
Guest_family: Yeah, he started having a sore throat last night. And that's why we are here. His eyes have been really puffy. Uh, we gave him some Benadryl."
4587,974,3853,Hm.
4588,974,3854,"When did it all start?
Guest_family: It started yesterday. All of a sudden, he started complaining saying, “Mama my nose is not working,” and yeah, I noticed he was breathing from his mouth."
4589,974,3854,"Any fever or any other symptoms?
Guest_family: Yeah, he had some low grade fever. He looked very tired and when I asked him he said that, “I feel like I cannot stand. I have no energy. I want to just lie down.”"
4590,974,3854,"I can notice that his voice is a little bit hoarse. How's he eating and drinking?
Guest_family: He's eating and drinking normally."
4591,974,3854,Any shortness of breath or pain in your stomach?
4592,974,3855,Any diarrhea or vomiting?
4593,975,3856,"Do you use tobacco, alcohol, or recreational drugs?"
4594,976,3857,"What's a young thirty one year old like you doing in my office today, ma'am?"
4595,976,3858,When was your fall?
4596,976,3859,What happened when you fell?
4597,976,3860,Did you twist your foot or ankle?
4598,976,3861,Have you had any imaging done on this foot?
4599,976,3862,What were the impressions of those images?
4600,976,3863,How was the pain progressed since the onset?
4601,976,3864,How long have you been wearing this walking boot?
4602,977,3865,Do you smoke cigarettes?
4603,977,3866,"Good, what about more illicit substances?"
4604,977,3867,"What about alcohol, do you drink?"
4605,978,3868,Do you mind elaborating more on your family history? Did either of your parents suffer from any medical problems?
4606,978,3869,Got it.
4607,978,3870,Thank you for further elaborating. I'm so sorry for your losses. Losing a parent let alone two is profoundly difficult.
4608,979,3870,Any muscular pain?
4609,979,3871,Any problem in walking?
4610,979,3872,Let me check your toes and fingers. Can you move them for me?
4611,979,3873,Everything looks fine. Nails looks fine too. No bluish discoloration no sign of any infection. Can you push your legs against my hand.
4612,979,3874,"Yes, both. Well, your muscular strength is equal and stable in both legs, so that's fine. Motion looks adequate."
4613,979,3874,Any tenderness?
4614,979,3875,And I don't see any swelling or fluid accumulation.
4615,980,3876,Do you have a known-
4616,980,3877,"Oh no, I meant family history of disease."
4617,981,3877,Have you experienced any headaches or blackouts recently?
4618,981,3878,Dizziness or seizure?
4619,981,3879,Any history of stroke?
4620,981,3880,"Okay, good."
4621,982,3880,"Hi there! I am Doctor Kim. Nice to meet you, miss."
4622,982,3881,How are you feeling today?
4623,982,3882,How old are you?
4624,982,3883,How is your pain in the left side?
4625,982,3884,Are you still having trouble with urination?
4626,982,3885,Okay. It looks like Doctor X did an exam yesterday. Doctor X consulted me on your status but I have a question for you. I see in your medical history that you had a bruised left kidney. Can you tell me more about the bruised kidney?
4627,983,3887,"Oh, I am sorry to hear about your mom."
4628,983,3888,Okay.
4629,984,3888,Where are you experiencing the most pain?
4630,984,3889,How long has this been going on?
4631,984,3890,Does the pain come and go?

4642,985,3899,Are you working currently?
4643,985,3900,Do you drink alcohol or use any recreational drugs?
4644,985,3901,"Have you ever taken any prescription drugs, muscle relaxants or sedative medications? 
Guest_family: I don't think that she has ever taken muscle relaxants or sedative medications without prescriptions. I give her, her medications every day so she doesn't forget."
4645,985,3901,"Oh, okay. 
Guest_family: She does have a pattern of self-prescribing for minor illness. She loves WebMD."
4646,985,3901,Okay. How have you been feeling lately? Have you been participating in social activities?
4647,985,3902,That is great to hear.
4648,986,3902,Do you have a history of surgeries?
4649,986,3903,How are you feeling after the biopsy?
4650,987,3904,Anybody else in your family suffers from this condition?
4651,987,3905,Okay.
4652,988,3905,"Hello Miss Jane, how are you?"
4653,988,3906,"So, tell me what brings you here?"
4654,988,3907,Start by telling the one troubling you the most.
4655,988,3908,Okay and do you feel any tingling sensation? Or feeling like your leg is giving away?
4656,988,3909,"Hm, tell me about your pain. Is it mild, moderate, or severe?"
4657,988,3910,Would you define it as sharp shooting pain or dull kind of radiating pain?
4658,988,3911,Okay. How long have you had this problem?
4659,988,3912,"I see, does it get worse when you walk?"
4660,988,3913,It looks like you have paresthesia in the toes of your right foot and I feel your left toe also has the same problem.
4661,988,3915,Well-
4662,988,3916,Thrombocythemia.
4663,988,3917,How are your allergies by the way?
4664,989,3918,Do you have any known allergies to medications?
4665,990,3919,"How about any congestion? Is it one week or more?
Guest_family: No did I say that? I meant two to three weeks. I am so worried. He is just one year."
4666,990,3919,"Don't worry let me see, can you tell me everything from the beginning?
Guest_family: Sure. It started off as a congestion, but then he started coughing about a week ago and it is getting worse."
4667,990,3919,"Okay, what else?
Guest_family: Actually, he had Pop Can just three days ago and I never found the top of that and was wondering if he had swallowed that."
4668,990,3919,"It is possible, have you seen any change in his breathing?
Guest_family: His breathing has not gotten worse since that happened."
4669,990,3919,"Any fever?
Guest_family: No. No fever."
4670,990,3919,Okay.
4671,991,3919,"Hi, how are you?"
4672,991,3920,"So, I see you recently moved to U S A from Brazil, right?"
4673,991,3921,"Wow, that's quite a move!"
4674,991,3922,How about your family; wife or girlfriend?
4675,991,3923,Nice. Did you travel outside the country recently or have risk of any kind of exposure?
4676,991,3924,"Okay. Tell me something, do you smoke or drink?"
4677,991,3925,And have you in the past used any recreational or illegal drugs?
4678,991,3926,"Okay, good."
4679,992,3926,"Do you drink, sir?"
4680,992,3927,How about tobacco? Do you smoke?
4681,992,3928,"How much do you smoke, sir?"
4682,993,3929,How are you feeling? You have been sick?
4683,993,3930,Do you get wet cough or it's dry? What color sputum comes out?
4684,993,3931,"Okay we will need to send it out to culture, maybe an infection."
4685,993,3931,"How about fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea anything like that? Are you sleeping well?"
4686,993,3932,Do you need anything for cough?
4687,993,3933,"Okay then why are you crying, ma'am?"
4688,993,3934,I am so sorry.
4689,994,3935,"Hi there, what's going on with you?"
4690,994,3936,"Oh okay, let me take a look."
4691,995,3936,"Good afternoon, sir. Is this your mother?"
4692,995,3937,"Great, please, give me some background information on your history."
4693,995,3938,"What do you mean, bad crowd?"
4694,995,3939,Did you see a doctor for this addiction?
4695,995,3940,How did they treat you at that time?
4696,995,3941,Did that help at all?
4697,995,3942,Do you remember the dosage that you were given?
4698,995,3943,How long did you take methadone for?
4699,995,3944,Did you ever try to decrease your dosage?
4700,995,3945,Have you been using heroin since?
4701,995,3946,Were you roommates at school using drugs?
4702,995,3947,"Good, when was the last time you used heroin?"
4703,995,3948,"Good, congratulations. When was the last time you had methadone?"
4704,995,3949,We can discuss that. Have you had any feelings of depression recently?
4705,995,3950,What about your energy?
4706,995,3951,"What about your enthusiasm for the foods or activities you enjoy? 
Guest_family: He hasn't had much enthusiasm for anything, either."
4707,995,3951,"Are you having any suicidal or homicidal thoughts or actions at this time?
Guest_family: No, nothing like that, doctor."
4708,995,3951,"Good, what about delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized thoughts or behaviors?"
4709,995,3952,Do you have any medical conditions in the past that I should know about?
4710,995,3953,"You completed your family and social history earlier with the nurses, is there anything you want to add to that?"
4711,995,3954,Do you have any allergies?
4712,995,3955,"Good, and do you take any medications right now?"
4713,995,3956,Have you had any surgeries in the past?
4714,996,3957,"Hi there, how is it going?
Guest_family: Hi doctor, I am his son Ethan."
4715,996,3957,Nice to meet you.
4716,996,3957,"So, I see your father has a history of drug abuse, right?
Guest_family: Yes."
4717,996,3958,"Yeah, this is really unfortunate. I can see these open wounds, it's because of the chronic abscesses.
Guest_family: The right thigh looks worse than the left one."
4718,996,3958,"Yeah, I see that. How old is your father?
Guest_family: He is sixty two."
4719,996,3958,"Does he have any other medical issues like sugar or blood pressure?
Guest_family: No."
4720,996,3958,"Okay, I think we need to surgically remove this whole area and then do a reconstruction.
Guest_family: And is that the only way?"
4721,996,3958,"According to me, yes! I mean the wounds are not healing and it is only getting worst. 
Guest_family: Okay then we will follow whatever you suggest."
4722,996,3958,Okay.
4723,997,3958,"Do you smoke cigarettes or use any tobacco products, miss?"
4724,997,3959,"Do you drink alcohol and if so, how many drinks do you consume in a typical week?"
4725,997,3960,Do you use any recreational drug or other substances?
4726,997,3961,Do you have children?
4727,997,3962,Do your children have any health conditions?
4728,997,3963,Are you married?
4729,998,3964,How is your family doing?
4730,998,3965,Are you aware of any medical issues in your family?
4731,999,3966,Have you ever had spine problems before?
4732,999,3967,"Well, it's broad. It could be an injury, or just any kind of pain."
4733,1000,3968,Any past medical history?
4734,1001,3969,"With ten being the worse pain ever, how would you rate your pain out of ten today, ma'am?"
4735,1001,3970,That's good. What helps the pain feel better?
4736,1002,3971,"Nurse, did you get the documents from the patient?
Guest_clinician: I did. Here is her full history and notes from her physical examination. She also completed the patient questionnaire before arriving. You can review that."
4737,1002,3971,"Thank you, Nurse. What is she here for today?
Guest_clinician: She came in for a consultation because she's been experiencing difficult headaches, tunnel vision, and dizziness."
4738,1002,3971,"Sounds good. Was there anything else? 
Guest_clinician: Oh, yeah. These are the results from her tests. She brought them so you could refer to them."
4739,1002,3971,"Thank you, Nurse. I'll go see her now."
4740,1002,3972,"What? You don't look old at all, ma'am."
4741,1002,3973,How can I help you today?
4742,1002,3974,When did they start?
4743,1002,3975,"Oh, wow. That long? Did you get them every day since then?"
4744,1002,3976,I'm sorry to hear that. How did the headaches feel?
4745,1002,3977,I haven't heard that description before. Would you say it was pulsating?
4746,1002,3978,Did you take any medication?
4747,1002,3979,I see you were given papaverine. Did that help?
4748,1002,3980,How long did you take it for?
4749,1002,3981,How often would you say you get headaches now?
4750,1002,3982,Do you take the papaverine when you feel it?
4751,1002,3983,I see. Did you ever experience any problems with your vision too?
4752,1002,3984,"Oh, wow. I will do a test right now to check your vision."
4753,1002,3985,I will. Does it give you any discomfort?
4754,1002,3986,"I see. I'll only do it to the side then. Just look forward for me, please."
4755,1002,3987,Are you able to see the light?
4756,1002,3988,It looks like you have trouble seeing things in your peripheral vision. The discomfort you experience with bright lights is also called photophobia.
4757,1002,3989,Yeah. You don't have to worry. Are you experiencing any dizziness or lightheadedness right now?
4758,1002,3990,Have you ever fainted before?
4759,1002,3991,That's good to hear. I'll write down that you experienced a syncope. Did you take any medication for this?
4760,1002,3992,"Oh, wow. Are you from Russia?"
4761,1002,3993,That's wonderful. How did the medicine help?
4762,1003,3994,Do you drink?
4763,1003,3995,How would you rate your pain?
4764,1003,3996,Then why do you need more pain medications?
4765,1003,3997,Do you have morphine? Do you need more?
4766,1004,3998,"Yeah, I am looking at her reports. She had surgery for spina bifida when she was a baby and they had to put a shunt. 
Guest_clinician: Yeah, later she had her uterus removed and also had to undergo a breast reduction surgery."
4767,1004,3998,Hm.
4768,1005,3998,Are you married or divorced?
4769,1005,3999,Okay.
4770,1005,4000,Do you smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol?
4771,1006,4001,What is your family medical history?
4772,1007,4002,"Good morning, ma'am. My chart says that you're forty nine years old, and White, is that correct?"
4773,1007,4003,What do you do for a living?
4774,1007,4004,"Great, welcome back to the Dermatology office, do you remember when your last appointment was?"
4775,1007,4005,"Good, that's what I have here as well, so has your acne improved since your last visit?"
4776,1007,4006,How long have you been dealing with this?
4777,1007,4007,Where do you see this rash?
4778,1007,4008,"I see, it appears that your acne is flaring, and there are small lesions on the follicles as well. Have you been taking your Amoxicillin and using your Tazorac?"
4779,1007,4009,"Good, the acne on your face appears to be clearing."
4780,1007,4010,"Okay, we might refill that. Have you had any other treatments aside from what I've done? I"
4781,1008,4011,It looks like your Xrays show bronchitis.
4782,1008,4012,"Yes, I'm going to prescribe you something that will help clear your lungs."
4783,1009,4012,How's it going X Y Z? I see you're in a walking boot. What happened?
4784,1009,4013,How'd it happen?
4785,1009,4014,"Dang, that sucks. Were you guys playing a home game?"
4786,1009,4015,You'll get them next time. Did you keep playing?
4787,1009,4016,I see. Who was the trainer that helped you?
4788,1009,4017,"Oh, John! He's a good friend of mine."
4789,1009,4018,"It looks like you have some tenderness around your navicular, which is a bone in your ankle."
4790,1009,4019,Which way did you twist your ankle?
4791,1009,4020,I see. Your foot inverted. Did it swell up right away?
4792,1009,4021,Continue to keep that tape on. Are you limping or anything?
4793,1009,4022,"I see. Well, I examined your foot, and it looks like the pain is around the top, back and middle of your foot."
4794,1010,4022,"Yeah so, we call it foreign body impaction. It is mostly affecting his right nostril and as you said there is constipation."
4795,1011,4023,Okay. Don't worry. Let's see. Oh wow!
4796,1011,4024,"Yeah, too bad, looks like from elbow to wrist. The whole medial side is burnt."
4797,1011,4025,"Okay, how old are you?"
4798,1011,4026,What is your job? I mean what do you do?
4799,1012,4027,Do you have any medical conditions that I should know about?
4800,1012,4028,"I also see here that you have cervical cancer, can you tell me more about that?"
4801,1012,4029,How would you describe the progression of your cancer?
4802,1013,4030,You can take Ibuprofen as needed for pain.
4803,1014,4030,Do you take anything for acid reflux?
4804,1014,4031,Is that twenty M G once a day?
4805,1015,4032,Do you smoke?
4806,1015,4033,How much do you smoke?
4807,1015,4034,Okay.
4808,1016,4034,Any numbness or tingling?
4809,1016,4035,Are your experiencing any muscle weakness?
4810,1016,4036,"Any problem walking, or did you lose balance or fall?"
4811,1016,4037,"So, your gait is fine. Any stroke in the past?"
4812,1017,4038,Past surgeries I should know of?
4813,1017,4039,"Oh wow, I see. When did you get these surgeries?"
4814,1017,4040,Any other medical history?
4815,1017,4041,Does the diagnosis bladder prolapse sound familiar?
4816,1017,4042,Have you followed up with your urologist recently?

4818,1018,4044,"So basically, you are just congested?"
4819,1018,4045,Any headache? What comes out of your nose?
4820,1018,4046,You feel hot?
4821,1018,4047,"Anyone sick at home?

4822,1019,4047,Are you married?
4823,1019,4048,Do you have any kids?
4824,1019,4049,Any abnormal pregnancy. Any abortions?
4825,1019,4050,Do you smoke or consume alcohol or have ever used any illicit drug?
4826,1020,4051,I want to go over your medical history. I see here you saw the dermatologist a month ago.
4827,1020,4052,Does hidradenitis suppurativa sound familiar?
4828,1020,4053,I ask because it's also included in your last visit with your dermatologist.
4829,1020,4054,Yes. There's a note here that you could've potentially had Staph with it as well.
4830,1020,4055,"It looks like you've had them in your upper mid thigh, vulva area, and the area between your vulva and anus."
4831,1020,4056,Right. And a history of asthma?
4832,1021,4058,"I am good, tell me what brings you here?"
4833,1021,4059,"Yeah, I see that you got nuclear and myocardial perfusion scan, which was normal. They were looking for some heart artery lesion but then it was thought to be due to spasm."
4834,1021,4060,It is also mentioned here that you have hyperlipidemia.
4835,1021,4061,And are you still smoking?
4836,1021,4062,"Hm. And would you say, you might have had some exertion recently or did some steep hiking or some cardio exercises which might have caused some additional stress on your heart causing chest pain?"
4837,1022,4063,I am sorry about that.
4838,1022,4064,Okay.
4839,1022,4064,When was this?
4840,1022,4066,Okay so we don't know.
4841,1023,4066,Do you smoke cigarettes?
4842,1023,4067,How many packs a day.
4843,1023,4068,"Okay, you should think about quitting."
4844,1024,4068,What happens when you take Sulfa drugs?

4850,1027,4073,What kind of issues?
4851,1027,4074,Did you do anything for it?
4852,1027,4075,"What is more difficult, day or night?"
4853,1027,4076,Is it complete hand or is there any part of hand that is worse than others?
4854,1027,4077,Is there pain anywhere else?
4855,1028,4078,Have you been in any accident?

4865,1030,4088,Have you seen any variation in your weight?
4866,1031,4089,How did your treatment for the thrombosis go? I believe we did it on February nineteen of two thousand and seven. We finished the note the next day in order to send to your other following doctor.
4867,1032,4090,Where are you having numbness?
4868,1032,4091,And no other symptoms? Any coughing or chest pain?
4869,1032,4092,Any visual changes or motor changes.
4870,1032,4093,Great. What about any phlegm or shortness of breath?
4871,1033,4094,How are you feeling?

4873,1033,4096,When did you first start experiencing joint pain?
4874,1033,4097,In what ways has it worsened?
4875,1033,4098,Have you noticed any increased swelling?
4876,1033,4099,I see here that you take the generic of Daypro. Is that helping?
4877,1033,4100,"And no redness to the area, right?"
4878,1033,4101,Fever or chills?
4879,1033,4102,"Are you going to the bathroom more often, experiencing excessive thirst, or other problems?"

4883,1034,4106,Anyone in your family been sick lately?
4884,1034,4107,Okay that means she will be treated.
4885,1034,4108,How about other family members?
4886,1034,4109,Good. Good.
4887,1035,4110,"So, tell me what's going on with you?"
4888,1035,4111,Where exactly did it hurt?
4889,1035,4112,"Okay, how do you feel now?"

4896,1035,4119,"Okay, and you had a gastric bypass surgery, one year ago."
4897,1035,4120,And you felt well after the surgery?
4898,1035,4121,Okay.
4899,1036,4121,"Okay, so it looks like your blood work shows that your sodium levels are very low. This could explain some of the symptoms you've been having lately."
4900,1036,4122,It could be due to a number of-
4901,1036,4123,Not necessarily. But I believe it's partly due to the diuretic that you've been taking these past few weeks. Your blood work also shows anemia. I'd like to start you on some iron supplements for now and get you back in for another eval. The front desk has access to your orders and they can print you out a lab slip.
4902,1037,4124,"So, you are a cigarette smoker?"
4903,1037,4125,How much do you some?
4904,1037,4126,How much is that exactly?

4915,1041,4136,"Good morning, ma'am. Can you tell me more about this low back pain?"
4916,1041,4137,What set this pain off? Is there any injury?
4917,1041,4138,What part of your lower back did you fall onto?

4920,1041,4141,What made you lose your footing?
4921,1041,4142,What treatments have you had for this?

4929,1042,4150,Were any of your children born through C sections?
4930,1043,4151,Have you ever had any major surgeries?
4931,1043,4152,Okay.
4932,1044,4152,"With ten being the worst pain imaginable, out of ten, how would you describe your pain today?"
4933,1044,4153,What makes the pain worse?
4934,1044,4154,Do you have any pain at night?
4935,1044,4155,How long have you been wearing that exterior knee brace?
4936,1045,4156,I need to ask you a few questions.
4937,1045,4157,Do you feel any weakness or tiredness?

4953,1050,4171,Hi there! How are you today?
4954,1050,4172,How long has this been going on?
4955,1050,4173,I would like to examine your abdomen. Is that okay?
4956,1051,4174,Can you please confirm the medications that you have already taken?
4957,1052,4175,Has anyone in your family had a history of heart disease or issues?
4958,1052,4176,"Oh, I am sorry to hear that. Do you know what kind of heart problem he had?"
4959,1052,4177,"Oh, coronary heart disease?"
4960,1052,4178,I see.
4961,1053,4178,"Good morning, ma'am. Just to confirm, you're thirty two years old, correct?"
4962,1053,4179,"Good, so, have you been able to get a P C P yet?"
4963,1053,4180,Are you in the process of getting one?
4964,1053,4181,"Good, um, what seems to be the problem today, then?"
4965,1053,4182,"I see, what were you going to see Doctor X Y Z for?"
4966,1053,4183,"Okay, have you seen Doctor X Y Z before?"
4967,1053,4184,"But you still don't have a P C P, correct?"
4968,1053,4185,"Okay, we've seen you quite a few times in here. You were in here last week and saw Doctor X Y Z for some back pain, how did they treat you?"
4969,1053,4186,"Okay, so, can you tell me more about your foot, please?"
4970,1053,4187,Have you ever talked to anyone about removing this hardware?
4971,1053,4188,"I see, how long have you had this foot pain?"
4972,1053,4189,Is there any injury here?
4973,1053,4190,Do any activities bother it?
4974,1053,4191,"I see, well, we've x rayed this before, and I see the hardware in there, but there's no apparent abnormality or evidence of loosening, at least from what I can see."
4975,1054,4191,Do you smoke or drink?
4976,1054,4192,Any drugs?
4977,1054,4193,Yeah.
4978,1054,4194,Okay.
4979,1055,4194,"Hello, miss. How are you? What brings you to my office today?"
4980,1055,4195,Great. That should be easy. How has the stress management been going to control the acne?
4981,1055,4196,Wonderful. Are will still clean from drinking and smoking? That can interact with your medications.
4982,1056,4197,So I have here that you're taking three different medications.
4983,1056,4198,I see. That's good. Did you refill your prescriptions with the newly revised doses? It looks like they changed the dosing of your medications at the hospital.
4984,1056,4199,"I advise that you take the doses that they prescribed. If you'd like me to put in a new order, please let me know."
4985,1057,4200,Any major surgeries in the past?
4986,1057,4201,"Oh, so cardiac catherization, correct?"
4987,1058,4202,"Hello, sir. I see you're being seen for an evaluation for your allergy. Can you please confirm your age?"
4988,1058,4203,"Let me take a look at your medical records. I see you were treated at the A B C Medical Center for an allergic reaction, correct?"
4989,1058,4204,Who told you to have a follow up?
4990,1058,4205,I see. Your records indicate you had some swelling around the eye on May third of two thousand and eight. The cause was unknown. I see you were transferred from A B C Medical Center to X Y Z Medical center that day.
4991,1058,4206,"Yeah, there is. It says here you have a history of renal failure, so you needed dialysis. They believe the allergic reaction was due to this medicine called, Keflex, which was used during your dialysis treatment. Does that name ring a bell?"
4992,1058,4207,"Usually, Keflex is used to treat a skin cellulitis dialysis shunt infection."
4993,1058,4208,I would like to ask you more about your allergies. What would you say you're allergic to?
4994,1058,4209,"I see. I'll put that down as grass allergies, and environmental and inhalant allergies. Do you have any life-threatening allergic reactions?"
4995,1058,4210,Have you ever had any swelling under the skin due to something you ate or touched?
4996,1058,4211,"That's great. I'm taking a look at your medications. I see you aren't taking anything for your allergies, but you are taking Atenolol. Do you have high blood pressure?"
4997,1058,4212,I see. All that's left from your report are the treatments they gave you before you were discharged from the hospital.
4998,1058,4213,Looks like they monitored you the whole time and gave you some corticosteroid therapy and antihistamine therapy. You didn't have any additional problems as well.
4999,1059,4214,"Miss Tara, you need to take your medications on time. You are hypertensive and your readings don't look good."
5000,1059,4215,If that's the case then I will make note in your file that you are not complying.
5001,1060,4216,"Oh, let me take a look."
5002,1061,4216,Any medical history?
5003,1061,4217,Are you taking anything for either?
5004,1061,4218,Have you had surgeries in the past?
5005,1062,4219,"Do you have a family history of any medical conditions, such as diabetes or heart disease?"
5006,1063,4220,How's your family?
5007,1063,4221,You must be so proud of your boys.
5008,1063,4222,I'm sure. And I have a few more questions before we wrap up.
5009,1063,4223,Do you drink or smoke?
5010,1064,4224,"How's it going, buddy? I haven't seen you in a long time"
5011,1064,4225,Nice. How's the family doing? Are they all well?
5012,1064,4226,"That's great to hear. Nobody has new medical conditions either, right?"
5013,1065,4227,"So, you and your husband live together, correct?"
5014,1065,4228,"Are you able to walk any distance without assistance?
Guest_family: She's most comfortable in her wheelchair, but she usually walks with a walker if she's at home."
5015,1065,4229,And how often do you walk with your walker?
5016,1065,4230,"Great. 
Guest_family: If I'm nearby, I like to keep any eye on her incase she feels unstable and needs help sitting back down."
5017,1065,4230,It's good that you're both looking out for each other. Now moving onto the last few questions. Do you smoke or drink?
5018,1065,4231,Did you smoke or drink in the past?
5019,1066,4232,You do not look so well today. What seems to be the problem?
5020,1066,4233,Do you have a history of drug use?
5021,1066,4234,What kind of drugs have you been using?
5022,1066,4235,Okay. How long have you been using?
5023,1066,4236,"Have you had a fever, chills, vomiting or diarrhea?"
5024,1067,4237,How would you rate your general health?
5025,1067,4238,I'm so sorry to hear about the loss of your husband. I can't imagine how difficult that must've been. I'm glad that you sought the care that you needed to feel better at that time. Did this happen when you were living in the United States or Korea?
5026,1067,4239,"Social support is very important, especially when you are processing the loss of a loved one."
5027,1067,4240,I have a few more questions before we move on. Any past medical problems?
5028,1067,4241,"When you say used to, do you mean it's been resolved now?"
5029,1067,4242,Great news. How about surgeries? Have you had any in the past?
5030,1067,4243,Any alcohol or tobacco?
5031,1068,4244,"Are you experiencing any headaches, or do you have any history of migraine?"
5032,1068,4245,Any temporary loss of consciousness?
5033,1068,4246,Any feeling of being off balance or fainting?
5034,1068,4247,Any continuous sound you may hear?
5035,1068,4248,Okay so no tinnitus. Any mouth sores or ulcers?
5036,1068,4249,"Do you notice any change in your voice, any hoarseness?"
5037,1068,4250,Did you notice any swelling in and around your mouth?
5038,1068,4251,Any history of goiter or swelling of your thyroid gland?
5039,1068,4252,Okay.
5040,1069,4252,"Hello, miss. How can I help?"
5041,1069,4253,You look beautiful and actually have a lot of fullness in the face.  It is great that you do not smoke and do not have history of skin disease. We can definitely help you with these minor issues.
5042,1070,4253,"Good afternoon, ma'am."
5043,1070,4254,"Remind me, how young are you?"
5044,1070,4255,"Great, and you've had a rotator cuff repair before, correct?"
5045,1070,4256,"Good, well, what seems to be the problem today?"
5046,1070,4257,"Oh no, have you had any recent imaging done on this shoulder?"
5047,1070,4258,"Thank you, yes, um, this M R I shows that you've torn that rotator cuff again."
5048,1070,4259,"Yes, we'll have to."
5049,1070,4260,Its less than one percent. We'll use antibiotics to control for infection the entire time.
5050,1070,4261,"Yes, you won't feel a thing."
5051,1071,4262,What brings you in today?
5052,1071,4263,Is the area still bleeding?
5053,1071,4264,Is there any pain in the area?
5054,1071,4265,Are you able to walk normally without pain or discomfort?
5055,1071,4266,Are you experiencing any numbness or loss of strength in the area?
5056,1071,4267,Do you have any other injuries on any other part of your body?
5057,1071,4268,Have you had any recent illnesses?
5058,1071,4269,Do you have any other concerns while you are here today?
5059,1072,4270,"What do you do for a living, sir?"
5060,1072,4271,"That's great, congratulations on your retirement!"
5061,1072,4272,"I just need some background information on you, sir. Do you smoke?"
5062,1072,4273,"Do you drink, sir?"
5063,1073,4274,Any surgical history?
5064,1073,4275,When did you have them taken out?
5065,1073,4276,Did you experience any complications post surgery?
5066,1073,4277,Who was the surgeon who did your thyroidectomy?
5067,1073,4278,What was the final diagnosis?
5068,1073,4279,Was the growth cancerous?
5069,1073,4280,"That's understandable. I'm sorry you had to go through that. Surgery is daunting, let alone surgery to remove cancer."
5070,1074,4280,"Welcome in. I am Doctor Welch. 
Guest_family: Thank you! It is nice to meet you."
5071,1074,4280,"How old is your daughter? 
Guest_family: She is three years old now."
5072,1074,4280,Hi there!
5073,1074,4281,"Mom I would like to start off with some questions regarding pregnancy, childbirth, and prior children. 
Guest_family: Okay."
5074,1074,4281,"Do you have any other children?
Guest_family: No. She is my only child."
5075,1074,4281,"Have you ever had any miscarriages or abortions prior to having your daughter? 
Guest_family: I had a very early miscarriage before getting pregnant again with her."
5076,1074,4281,"I am so sorry to hear that.
Guest_family: Thank you. I was difficult but when I got pregnant again with her, we were so overjoyed."
5077,1074,4281,"Did you have any difficulties or problems during your pregnancy with her. 
Guest_family: I had the flu in my seventh or eighth month of pregnancy. Other than that I had no problems."
5078,1074,4281,"How far along were you when you gave birth? 
Guest_family: I was thirty six weeks."
5079,1074,4281,"Did you have a vaginal birth or a C section?

5081,1074,4281,"How long were you in labor for? 
Guest_family: I was in labor for eleven hours."
5082,1074,4281,"Were you given any anesthesia during the birth?

Guest_family: Seven pounds and ten ounces."
5084,1074,4281,"Do you recall her Apgars score?

5085,1074,4281,"How long did you stay in the hospital after the birth? 
Guest_family: Five days."
5086,1074,4281,"Let us move to questions regarding your daughter. Has she had any development problems? 
Guest_family: She did not walk until well after two years old. She only rolled from side to side at two."
5087,1074,4281,"Okay. How old was she when she spoke her first words?
Guest_family: She was around one or two."
5088,1074,4281,"When did she start to feed herself, using her hands? 
Guest_family: She was two."
5089,1074,4281,"Has she been toilet trained yet? 
Guest_family: No. She is not interested but I have been trying."
5090,1075,4281,Okay and are you working?
5091,1075,4282,"Good, so you are one happy married couple working together."
5092,1075,4283,"And how about tobacco, do you smoke or eat?"
5093,1075,4284,Any use of drugs or alcohol?
5094,1075,4285,"Yeah, like cocaine or anything like that."
5095,1075,4287,Alright.
5096,1076,4287,"Well, looking at your hand x ray, the bone looks in alignment, and I don't see any effusion."
5097,1076,4287,Any tenderness or pain?
5098,1076,4288,There is no asymmetry. Can you move your hand up and down? Now rotate it. Can you move your fingers?
5099,1076,4289,Can you bend your hand?
5100,1076,4290,Perfect.
5101,1077,4290,How about any surgeries in the past?
5102,1077,4291,Okay and anything else?
5103,1077,4292,"Wow, you remember the years also."
5104,1078,4293,"So, do you drink or smoke, sir?"
5105,1078,4294,What do you do for a living?
5106,1078,4295,Do you work the normal day shift?
5107,1078,4296,Are you back at Wichita State this semester?
5108,1078,4297,Is everything okay?
5109,1078,4298,That's understandable. Are you dating right now?
5110,1078,4299,Is there any significant stress in your relationship?
5111,1079,4300,"What brings you in today, miss?"
5112,1079,4301,When did you go to the dentist?
5113,1079,4302,"What happened at the dentist? Also, sorry, but how old are you."
5114,1079,4303,How long did the episode last?
5115,1079,4304,Is this the only time that this has happened?
5116,1079,4305,How long did the vertigo last?
5117,1079,4306,Have you had any other dizzy episodes?
5118,1079,4307,"Are you left handed, or right?"
5119,1079,4308,Have you experienced any slurred speech or trouble swallowing?
5120,1079,4309,Have you had any continuing weakness other than the time in January?
5121,1079,4310,Have you experienced any headaches or visual changes?
5122,1079,4311,Any continuing vertigo or lightheadedness?
5123,1080,4312,"Oh wow, you got stung quite a few times."
5124,1080,4314,Did you notice redness and swelling right away?
5125,1080,4315,How long did it take for your body to react?
5126,1080,4316,"Did you experience any shortness of breath, itching, or hives?"
5127,1080,4317,And no tongue swelling or trouble swallowing?
5128,1080,4318,Have you gotten stung in the past? Or is this your first time?
5129,1080,4319,Did you take Benadryl again today?
5130,1080,4321,Did you take your daily medications today?
5131,1081,4322,What is your family medical history?
5132,1082,4323,Were you ever diagnosed with any blood or heart disease?
5133,1082,4324,Any other past medical issues?
5134,1083,4325,"Any major or minor surgeries done in the past?
Guest_family: Sorry, I have no idea about it.
Guest_family: I just started working for him."
5135,1084,4325,I can see your medication list here.
5136,1084,4325,Do you take Accutane and Ovcon?
5137,1084,4326,Okay.
5138,1085,4327,What are you taking?
5139,1085,4328,Is that only for pain?
5140,1086,4329,"Thanks, nurse. How are you feeling today, miss? Welcome back to the Pulmonary Medicine Clinic. What happened yesterday?"
5141,1086,4330,That's good to hear. What happened yesterday that caused you to want to come in so urgently?
5142,1086,4331,Are you experiencing any coughing?
5143,1086,4332,Have you been producing any mucus the times that you do cough?
5144,1086,4333,Okay. Any fevers or chills?
5145,1086,4334,Do you have any other symptoms currently?
5146,1086,4335,During physical activity do you seem out of breath or more tired than usual? I want to see if your pulmonary system is inhibited.
5147,1087,4336,"Hello sir, it's been a while since your last visit. How have you been?"
5148,1087,4337,You are right! It was August second of two thousand and two to be very precise.
5149,1087,4337,"Please confirm for the records, you are a white married man and must be forty nine years old now. Am I right?"
5150,1087,4338,Are you still working in that airplane company?
5151,1087,4339,"That is so nice! Good for you man! So, tell me how can I help you today? What brought you to our dermatology department today?"
5152,1087,4340,Is it only on the right side or anywhere else?
5153,1087,4341,Tell me more about it. How did it start? When did you first notice it?
5154,1087,4342,When did you notice it?
5155,1087,4343,Did you get any treatment for this? Any over the counter medicines?
5156,1087,4344,"Okay, do you bathe every day?"
5157,1087,4345,"Okay, here is what I think, all your symptoms are pointing towards hyperesthesia. I would like to run some tests to find the underlying cause and then we will start the treatment. A nurse will come and take you to the lab. Does this sound good to you?"
5158,1088,4346,Are you finished with your cancer treatments?
5159,1088,4347,That is great! When was your last radiation treatment?
5160,1089,4348,Do you smoke?
5161,1089,4349,Do you have any plans of quitting?
5162,1089,4350,"As your doctor, I'd advise that you consider nicotine patches and find ways to break your smoking habit."
5163,1089,4351,Do you drink?
5164,1089,4352,Are you married?
5165,1089,4353,"Aw, how old are they?"
5166,1089,4354,That's great. I'm sure they keep you busy. Any hobbies?
5167,1090,4355,"Good morning, ma'am. Before we begin today, can you confirm your age for me?"
5168,1090,4356,"Great, thank you. What seems to be the problem today, ma'am?"
5169,1090,4357,"Yes, how would you describe your arthritis?"
5170,1090,4358,"I see, so the antiinflammatories and rest haven't helped at all?"
5171,1090,4359,"I see, I believe you'd be a good candidate for a knee replacement."
5172,1090,4360,"Um, it's less than one percent, we use prophylactic antibiotics to control for infection the entire time."
5173,1090,4361,"Yes, you won't feel a thing."
5174,1091,4362,Welcome to the clinic.
5175,1091,4363,Are you from the area?
5176,1091,4364,It is a wonderful city. Do you have kids?
5177,1091,4365,"Do you have any history or present use of tobacco, alcohol and recreational drugs or substances?"
5178,1092,4366,Any of your family members have issues like seizures?
5179,1093,4367,"Do you have a sore throat, cough or earache?"
5180,1094,4368,Can you tell me what are the diseases you have been diagnosed with in the past?
5181,1094,4369,"Ok, is there anything else?"
5182,1094,4370,"And it is type two diabetes, right?"
5183,1094,4371,Thank you!
5184,1095,4371,"Good afternoon, sir. Do you remember the details of your surgery?"
5185,1095,4372,"Well, um, we did a right orchiectomy due to your testicular cancer, when did you have that?"
5186,1095,4373,"Good, while you're here, do you have any other conditions that I should be aware of?"
5187,1095,4374,"Thank you, what about allergies, do those bother you?"
5188,1095,4375,"Do you have them in the spring, or in the fall?"
5189,1095,4376,What allergy symptoms do you have usually?
5190,1095,4377,"Okay, yes, I'm familiar with that. Have you ever had any other surgeries?"
5191,1095,4378,"I see, what about any other major medical conditions?"
5192,1095,4379,Which hands did you have it in?
5193,1096,4380,"Good morning, Miss X Y Z, correct?"
5194,1096,4381,"Before we begin, I just need a few pieces of information. How old are you?"
5195,1096,4382,"Good, thank you. Next, which hand do you write with?"
5196,1096,4383,"Finally, what do you do for a living?"
5197,1096,4384,"Very nice, so, how did you get hurt?"
5198,1096,4385,How big was the gap that you stepped in?
5199,1096,4386,Which knee did you hurt?
5200,1096,4387,Did you have surgery after the accident?
5201,1096,4388,"Okay, yes, I see."
5202,1096,4389,Do you have any imaging of this knee?
5203,1096,4390,Can I see that report?
5204,1096,4391,"Okay, so this M R I from September two thousand six shows some nonspecific edema anterior to the patellar tendon, but thankfully there's no evidence of fracture of ligamentous avulsion or abnormality."
5205,1096,4392,"There's some bleeding in the bone there, but nothing is broken or out of alignment."
5206,1096,4393,"Oh certainly, yes, it is. What treatments have you had for this knee, aside from surgery?"
5207,1096,4394,Where is your knee pain?
5208,1096,4395,Does the pain go down your leg at all?
5209,1096,4396,"Yes, that's the femur."
5210,1096,4397,Does it go into your thigh at all?
5211,1096,4398,Do you feel anything in the feet?
5212,1096,4399,Are you having any back pain?
5213,1096,4400,Does anything make your knee pain worse?
5214,1096,4401,What kind of symptoms do you see when you walk on this?
5215,1096,4402,"That numbness and tingling you feel in the thigh, do you feel that in the knee at all?"
5216,1096,4403,"What about this, when I touch the knee do you feel any abnormal discomfort or pain over the rest of the knee?"
5217,1096,4404,"What about this, this is the fibular head, which is where you feel the pins and needles. I'm applying pretty heavy pressure here, how would you describe what you're feeling?"
5218,1096,4405,Is there any instability?
5219,1096,4406,Are you working right now?
5220,1096,4407,Any allergies I should know about?
5221,1096,4408,"Okay, have there been any changes in how you're walking?"
5222,1096,4409,That's certainly a possibility. How would you describe your pain?
5223,1096,4410,"Okay, does the pain wake you up at night?"
5224,1096,4411,Does anything make this feel better?
5225,1096,4412,"Out of ten, with ten being the worst pain ever, how would you describe your pain on average?"
5226,1096,4413,What about at its worst?
5227,1096,4414,"Finally, what about when the pain is at its least?"
5228,1096,4415,"Thanks. I see. They said that there is nonspecific edema anterior to the patellar tendon, but there is no acute fracture or any ligament abnormalities. That's good."
5229,1097,4415,How old are you?
5230,1097,4416,What gender do you identify with?
5231,1097,4417,How long have you had this back and buttock pain?
5232,1097,4418,How have you been managing this?
5233,1097,4419,Has there been any improvement?
5234,1097,4420,"This C T Scan you had recently shows sclerosis, with some healing of a L five compression fracture, but if you look here, the healing is not complete."
5235,1097,4421,I believe you'd be a candidate for a bilateral L five kyphoplasty.
5236,1097,4422,"It's a small procedure on that L five vertebra. Its minimally invasive, and we can actually do it as an outpatient procedure."
5237,1097,4423,"Very low, historically, they're less than one percent."
5238,1097,4424,We'll use antibiotics in order to control for infection.
5239,1097,4425,"Yes, you'll be asleep for the whole thing."
5240,1097,4426,"Awesome, I agree. Do you have control over your bladder and bowel movements?"
5241,1097,4427,Do you wear a brace or corset normally?
5242,1097,4428,"Okay, last question, can you notice any weakness in your body?"
5243,1098,4429,"Good afternoon, sir, and who's the patient today? You, or your daughter?
Guest_family: Not me today, its my daughter."
5244,1098,4429,"And how old are you, dear?"
5245,1098,4430,What seems to be the problem today?
5246,1098,4431,"I see, tennis, huh? Was there any contact involved?"
5247,1098,4432,Are you able to stand on this knee?
5248,1098,4433,Have you ever hurt this knee before?
5249,1098,4434,I assume you had surgery for that?
5250,1098,4435,"How did you recover from this?
Guest_family: She didn't do well, she didn't do what we or the others doctors suggested, and the knee never really got the same tightness back."
5251,1098,4435,"What did they do about that?
Guest_family: I have it in my notes here, they did an, um, A C L revision. That was done by Doctor Y."
5252,1098,4435,"When was that done?
Guest_family: Looks like it was at the end of two thousand eight."
5253,1098,4435,"Following the revision, how did you cover?"
5254,1098,4436,"Good, was there any instability following the revision?"
5255,1099,4437,How're you feeling today?
5256,1099,4438,Are you still experiencing any symptoms?
5257,1099,4439,"Good, good."
5258,1100,4439,Any medical problems that run in the family?
5259,1101,4440,"Hi Mister B, nurse tells me you had a fall?"
5260,1101,4441,"Okay, tell me what happened?"
5261,1101,4443,"I see, did you lose consciousness after the fall?"
5262,1101,4444,"So, is your head hurting?"
5263,1101,4445,"Okay, any neck or back pain?"
5264,1101,4446,Any stomach pain?
5265,1101,4447,"Pain anywhere else, in extremities, hand or leg?"
5266,1101,4448,"Okay, and how old are you?"
5267,1101,4449,Okay.
5268,1102,4449,Let's talk about your family history.
5269,1102,4450,Can you tell me about any kind of medical traits that run in your family?
5270,1102,4451,What about any heart disease?
5271,1103,4452,"Hello, Nurse. Could you give me a run down on the eleven month old patient? 
Guest_clinician: The patient was presented with stage two neuroblastoma on the left when he was six weeks old. It was completely resected. It was shown not to be N Myc amplified and had some favorable Shimada histology."
5272,1103,4452,"Great. Did he have a follow up after?
Guest_clinician: He did. There was a second primary in his right adrenal gland. They performed a biopsy, which was consistent with neuroblastoma with favorable Shimada histology."
5273,1103,4452,"Did he receive any chemotherapy?
Guest_clinician: He is now being treated with it per protocol P nine six four one and not on study. His last chemotherapy appointment was on May twenty first two thousand and seven. They used carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin."
5274,1103,4452,"What did they do after chemotherapy? 
Guest_clinician: He received G C S F daily because he had neutropenia that delayed his second cycle."
5275,1103,4452,"Thank you, Nurse. I'll go talk to the mother. 
Guest_clinican: No problem, Doctor."
5276,1103,4452,"Hello, ma'am. It's nice to see you again. How is your little boy doing?
Guest_family: Not so well. Since out last visit, he had a stuffy nose for a couple of days."
5277,1103,4452,"Is it getting worse?
Guest_family: I think it's getting better now. It isn't as stuffy."
5278,1103,4452,"That's good to hear. Has he been sick or had any fevers?
Guest_family: Nope. Just the stuffy nose."
5279,1103,4452,"Has he been able to eat anything?
Guest_family: At times, he didn't want to eat. It seemed like he wasn't hungry."
5280,1103,4452,"Does he still have a reduced appetite?
Guest_family: Not anymore. He's starting to eat again."
5281,1103,4452,"Did he have any nausea or vomiting after he ate?
Guest_family: Thankfully, no. I would have made my husband clean up the vomit."
5282,1103,4452,"That's great. Is he able to pee and poop fine? No diarrhea, right?
Guest_family: His poop has been solid. I haven't seen anything bad about his pee either."
5283,1103,4452,"Great. Would you be able to open his mouth for me? I just want to check if everything's fine inside. 
Guest_family: Of course. Say ah."
5284,1103,4453,"Thank you. Oh, wow. It looks like he's showing some symptoms of thrush again. 
Guest_family: Oh, no. Should we restart fluconazole?"
5285,1103,4453,"It's just a fungal infection inside the mouth. I'll prescribe him fluconazole. It should get rid of it. 
Guest_family: Thank you so much. You all have been so helpful. My little boy is slowly getting better."
5286,1104,4453,"So, how are long have you had pain in this hip?"
5287,1104,4454,How old are you now?
5288,1104,4455,"Have you seen another doctor for this, or am I the first?"
5289,1104,4456,What did those doctors tell you?
5290,1104,4457,Does your pain radiate into your legs?
5291,1104,4458,"Has your pain been present for the eight years, or did it come and go?"
5292,1104,4459,Okay. The x rays from Doctor A B C show severe degenerative changes as well as avascular necrosis of the femoral head. What else did the Doctor do for you?
5293,1104,4460,Do you remember the names of the procedures suggested?
5294,1104,4461,"I saw you come in with a cane, do you have groin pain as well?"
5295,1104,4462,"Besides the pain medication, have you had anything else?"
5296,1104,4463,Okay. Do you drink?
5297,1105,4464,Let me examine your skin.
5298,1105,4465,It looks normal and well hydrated. Any excessive sweating?
5299,1105,4466,I don't see any injury or wounds.
5300,1105,4467,Its just a normal protocol to ask these questions for every new patient.
5301,1105,4468,Thank you for your cooperation.
5302,1106,4468,Hi there! I am Doctor Kirkland.
5303,1106,4469,How are you feeling?
5304,1106,4470,That's okay. Do you remember what happened to you before you came here?
5305,1106,4471,Can you tell me about your past medical history?
5306,1106,4472,Take your time.
5307,1106,4473,Okay.
5308,1106,4474,What is the name of your doctor?
5309,1106,4475,Doctor X? Across the street?
5310,1106,4476,I will have your nurse give him a call and get some background information from him.
5311,1106,4477,"Can you please give Doctor X a call and get mister Jones' medical history? 
Guest_clinician: Yes, of course."
5312,1106,4477,Thank you.
5313,1107,4477,Any issues from head to toe?
5314,1108,4478,"Hello, it's been two months already?"
5315,1108,4479,Just feels like yesterday.
5316,1109,4479,Tell me about your family medical history.
5317,1110,4480,And are you working? What do you do?
5318,1110,4481,Oh wow!
5319,1110,4482,"And if you don't mind me asking, do you drink alcohol?"
5320,1110,4483,Sorry I need to ask these questions it's a protocol.
5321,1110,4484,And can I put down here that you don't smoke or use any kinds of drugs?
5322,1110,4485,Cool.
5323,1111,4485,"Okay, so where do you live?"
5324,1112,4486,"So, he is Arjun, and he is thirty seven years old and was complaining of chest pain."
5325,1112,4487,"We are good thanks for asking. 
Guest_clinician: Hi there Arjun, I am doctor J and I am assisting Doctor Wilson today. So, chest pain huh?"
5326,1112,4488,"Yeah. I am suspecting coronary spasm but that's questionable. 
Guest_clinician: Okay."
5327,1112,4488,"I did run a cardiac enzyme profile and it was negative. 
Guest_clinician: Alright. And he also has hyperlipidemia?"
5328,1112,4488,"Yes, he does.
Guest_clinician: Okay and did you order an E K G?"
5329,1112,4488,"I did, it is normal too. 
Guest_clinician: Don't worry Arjun, we will take of you."
5330,1113,4489,"So, do you live in the area?"
5331,1113,4490,I'm sorry to hear that.
5332,1113,4491,Do you smoke or drink?
5333,1113,4492,Do you use any illicit drugs or substances?
5334,1114,4494,Does this help the pain?
5335,1114,4495,"Good morning, sir. My nurse's chart says that you're thirty four years old. Is that correct?"
5336,1114,4496,How long have you had this back pain?
5337,1114,4497,Does the pain go into your legs?
5338,1114,4498,Is there any injury that started this pain?
5339,1114,4499,Have you had back pain or surgeries before this injury?
5340,1114,4500,Are you having weakness in the legs?
5341,1114,4501,"Okay, I believe you are a good candidate for surgery, sir. It seems like you have a lot of weakness and pain in the S one nerve root distribution."
5342,1114,4502,"Overall, the risk of infection is very low, less than one percent. We use antibiotics to control for infection the entire time."
5343,1114,4503,"Yes, you'll be under anesthesia. You won't feel a thing."
5344,1115,4504,"Hello, miss. Doctor X and I will be going over your medical history with you. Before we begin, could you confirm your age for me?"
5345,1115,4505,"Thank you. Doctor X, could you go over the diagnosis of erythema nodosum?
Doctor_2: She was diagnosed in two thousand and four after a biopsy was done that confirmed erythema nodosum, but the detail from the Netherlands is not that specific."
5346,1115,4505,"What kind of procedures were done to address it? 
Doctor_2: She had undergone a colonoscopy to address secondary diseases that may have been present because of the erythema nodosum, correct miss?"
5347,1115,4506,"Were there any findings, Doctor X? 
Doctor_2: The findings were uncertain if the terminal ileum had abnormal biopsies. However, the skin biopsy mentioned some fibrosis, basal proliferation, and inflammatory cells in the subcutis."
5348,1115,4506,"I see. Her report states something about a tibia and fibula fracture on her right leg before the erythema nodosum. Are these skin lesions due to the fracture? 
Doctor_2: The skin lesions are not associated with the fracture, correct ma'am?"
5349,1115,4507,"Thank you. Did anything occur before the skin lesions? 
Doctor_2: She had cosmetic surgery done on her jaw."
5350,1115,4507,"Ma'am, I see you visited our clinic and the Dermatology several times, correct?"
5351,1115,4508,"Doctor X, did you confirm with any tests? 
Doctor_2: Yes. There was an initial S E D above one hundred and ten and her C P R was increased."
5352,1115,4508,"Great. In the visits after, were there any other problems found? 
Doctor_2: The reports says that no other abnormalities were found. However, I do see something about her first visit."
5353,1115,4508,"Could you explain what it says?
Doctor_2: She has some M T P detected, which could have been signs of erythema nodosum. However, the Dermatology did not agree, and they believed it to be venous stasis."
5354,1115,4508,"The venous stasis could have been related to the fracture, right? 
Doctor_2: That is correct."
5355,1115,4508,"Her initial visit reports suspicion of I B D, sarcoid inflammatory arthropathy, and lupus. Why was that? 
Doctor_2: She had a questionable rheumatoid fracture even though her C C P was negative. Her A N A was positive at one to four zero. There was a persistent speckled pattern. However, the rest of the lupus serologies were negative."
5356,1115,4508,"What lupus serologies were used? 
Doctor_2: Double stranded D N A, R N P, Smith, R O, and L A were used."
5357,1115,4508,"How did her cardiolipin antibodies panel look? 
Doctor_2: They were all negative. We made sure I g M, I g G, and I g A were less than ten."
5358,1115,4508,"I see. Was there anything else in the report? 
Doctor_2: She had her beta 2 glycoprotein one or R V V T tested."
5359,1115,4508,"That seems important because of the livedo pattern. 
Doctor_2: Exactly. That's why they concluded it was an onset of lupus and not rheumatoid arthritis because the arthritis couldn't be associated with erythema nodosum."
5360,1115,4508,"Why did she undergo a C T scan?
Doctor_2: We feared she had lymphoma. The scan of her chest, abdomen, and pelvis were done to rule out sarcoid."
5361,1115,4508,"I see. The results came out normal, right?
Doctor_2: That's correct."
5362,1115,4508,"Did you change some of you habits to help your bowels, ma'am?"
5363,1115,4509,"That's good. What was found Doctor X? 
Doctor_2: There was evidence of B twelve deficiency with a high methylmalonic and high homocystine levels along with a low normal B twelve in addition to iron studies consistent with iron deficiency and an initially low M C V."
5364,1115,4509,"That gives the possibility of inflammatory bowel disease, right?
Doctor_2: Correct. That's stated in the report."
5365,1115,4509,"Were there any tests done to confirm this? 
Doctor_2: She underwent a colonoscopy, which showed nothing. Her endoscopy was also normal. Recently, she underwent a second coloscopy, and no evidence of inflammatory bowel disease was seen after viewing it microscopically."
5366,1115,4509,"Nothing was seen microscopically? 
Doctor_2: Actually, we determined there were aggregates of eosinophils."
5367,1115,4509,That sounds important. That could be due to an allergic reaction or an emergence of Crohn Disease. I will have to discuss with Doctor Y from Gastroenterology to see the significance.
5368,1115,4510,"Is that correct, Doctor X?
Doctor_2: That is. I think these details were from somewhere else."
5369,1115,4510,"At least we are aware of it. What medication was provided during her first visit? 
Doctor_2: It looks like she was placed on forty milligrams of prednisone. The strength was reduced over time."
5370,1115,4510,"This may be a reason to her acne. Was she taken off this medication?
Doctor_2: Yes, she was. There were too many adverse effects."
5371,1115,4510,"What was she places on after?
Doctor_2: It looks like she started a point six m g colchicine, which she took daily."
5372,1115,4510,"How were her inflammatory markers after taking it? 
Doctor_2: Her markers were under control and positive. She also didn't have any evidence of erythema nodosum."
5373,1115,4510,"That is great. How did you like that medication, ma'am?"
5374,1115,4511,"I see. Is that stated on the report, Doctor X? 
Doctor_2: It is. I also see that she was reevaluated by Dermatology."
5375,1115,4511,"Did they find anything apparent? 
Doctor_2: No, they didn't. They didn't find any evidence of erythema nodosum."
5376,1115,4511,"What was the plan following that? 
Docotr_2: It looks like we proceeded with a D E X A scan and checked her vitamin D levels."
5377,1115,4511,"Was there any medication prescribed? 
Doctor_2: We ordered vitamin D and calcium to be bought over the counter so that her bones were protected. However, they use of them was stopped until we figured out the underlying cause of her disease."
5378,1115,4511,"I see. Other than the fracture and jaw surgery, was there anything else? 
Doctor_2: It shows she had Varicella and Mononucleosis, correct ma'am?"
5379,1115,4512,"That's good. Our recent physical exam with you from last August showed changes in your venous stasis and diffuse periarticular ankle edema. Fortunately, we did not find any erythema nodosum, but the livedo patter was still present."
5380,1115,4513,"We did find a heart murmur, so we will conduct an echocardiogram. Doctor X, could you confirm all the details form the workup, please?
Doctor_2: Of course. Her A C E levels were normal. Her sed rate was around 30, which was high. Before that, it was around one ten, which is even higher. Her R V V T was normal. The rheumatoid factor was negative. The urinalysis was also normal. She had a C R P level of two point three, which was high. Her C C P came out negative. Her C B C displayed microcytosis and hypochromia with hematocrit levels of thirty seven point seven. Her hematocrit levels improved to forty point three later on, and she did not have any hypochromia, microcytosis, or anemia present."
5381,1115,4513,"Thank you for all that information. Does all this information and history seem to be correct, ma'am?"
5382,1115,4514,"No problem. I see you're here today regarding some mild but intense skin rashes. You mentioned that you thought it was erythema nodosum, correct?"
5383,1115,4515,"I will take note of that. You also mentioned something about a rash before. Did you have a rash that was sensitive to U V light, like sunlight?"
5384,1115,4516,When did you notice the rashes?
5385,1115,4517,I see. Do you think it had to do anything with your acne?
5386,1115,4518,"The prednisone and colchicine we mentioned earlier, correct?"
5387,1115,4519,Is there anything else you would like to ask?
5388,1115,4520,I'll discus that with you right now.
5389,1116,4521,Anyone sick in your family?
5390,1116,4522,"So, everyone is healthy?"
5391,1117,4523,"Mister Sunil, your blood pressure is high, and I am noticing this from past two-three times you have been here. It's been constantly high, you are not taking it seriously."
5392,1117,4524,Are you noting your readings? Did you bring it with you?
5393,1117,4525,"Well, it's up and I am little bothered by it."
5394,1118,4525,What is your family medical history?
5395,1118,4526,Did your dad pass from colon cancer?
5396,1118,4527,"I am sorry. Do you have any family history of any neurological disorders like, M S, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's or epilepsy?"
5397,1119,4528,Hello. I see you're here for a follow up. Did you get your blood work done?
5398,1119,4529,"Let me take a look. Oh, wow. It looks like your blood sugar is high. Are you exercising every day?"
5399,1119,4530,You are at risk of developing type two diabetes.
5400,1120,4530,Have you had ever had surgery?
5401,1120,4531,"Thank you, what about any other parts of the body, like your eyes, ears, or nose?"
5402,1120,4532,"Thank you, think hard, any other surgeries you can remember?"
5403,1120,4533,I see. Thank you for sharing that with me.
5404,1121,4533,Hi there! How are you doing?
5405,1121,4534,Strange how?
5406,1121,4535,When did you take the Ecstasy?
5407,1122,4536,Do you live alone?
5408,1122,4537,Oh wow. I'm so deeply sorry for your loss. Losing a loved one is incredibly difficult. I lost my sister to cervical cancer two years ago. It was one of the hardest experiences of my life.
5409,1122,4538,"Yes, definitely. How have you been doing otherwise?"
5410,1122,4539,Gardening is a great hobby.
5411,1122,4540,"And as your doctor I have to ask, but any history of alcohol or drug use?"
5412,1123,4541,Hello. How are you doing today?
5413,1123,4542,I'm sorry to hear that. What's been happening?
5414,1123,4543,That must be really hard. I'm sorry to hear that they're divorced. Who do you live with right now?
5415,1123,4544,That's nice. Now you can ask for more gifts during Christmas.

5693,1179,4799,"So, no pain in the hips or back?"
5694,1180,4800,"Hi, what is going on?
Guest_family: She was doing well until this morning, but now she can barely move her right arm and is having speech issues. She can't seem to comprehend words. I think it is a stroke."
5695,1180,4800,"We see this a lot at A B C Medical Center. I am glad you came. You just saw Doctor H, right?
Guest_family: Yes. We did a C T head scan and labs."
5696,1180,4800,"Okay. Where is she living? With you?
Guest_family: No. She is at the Life Care Center."
5697,1180,4800,"Ma'am, do you have headache or chest pain?"
5698,1180,4801,Ma'am. Do you have vision issues?
5699,1180,4802,"Any shortness of breath?
Guest_family: She is breathing fine."
5700,1180,4802,"Have your symptoms improved at all? Or have they worsened since this morning?
Guest_family: No. They have stayed constant."
5701,1181,4802,I think you have a muscular strain.
5702,1181,4803,So right side shoulder strain and maybe a little bit of nerve compression.
5703,1181,4804,Maybe. I will do further evaluation and treatment.
5704,1182,4805,"Can you tell me more about your daughter, ma'am?
Guest_family: Sure, well she's fourteen now, um, she's right handed, and she just started high school."
5705,1182,4805,"Has she ever had surgery?  
Guest_family: Yeah, she had an, um, lipomyomeningocele repair when she was about three days old, and then again when she was three and a half years old."
5706,1182,4805,"When was her last surgery? 
Guest_family: Um, it was in March of nineteen ninety five."
5707,1182,4805,"How did she do following the second surgery? 
Guest_family: She did well, honestly."
5708,1182,4805,"So, what brings you in for a visit today?"
5709,1182,4806,How long have you had this pain?
5710,1182,4807,When is your pain the worst?
5711,1182,4808,"What do you take? 
Guest_family: She takes Advil, Motrin, and Tylenol P M."
5712,1182,4808,"Wow, that's a lot. Looks like you have some patch sensory loss in the L four to S one region. Are you going to the bathroom regularly?"
5713,1183,4809,"Well, he has improved clinically but would require acute care.
Guest_clinician: Oh, I see."
5714,1184,4809,"Good morning, ma'am. Can you confirm your age for me, please?"
5715,1184,4810,How are you recovering from your operation?
5716,1184,4811,"Um, we did a left upper lobectomy for your stage I A non small cell lung cancer."
5717,1184,4812,"Absolutely, do you have the results of your pelvic C T?"
5718,1184,4813,"Thank you, so this shows an enlarging simple cyst of the left kidney."
5719,1184,4814,"Well, that's why we did the barium swallow, which showed a small hiatal hernia with minimal reflux."
5720,1184,4815,"So, I have your x rays from November twenty third two thousand nine here, we did an A P and lateral view, and they're normal."
5721,1184,4816,Are you having any pain with swallowing food?
5722,1184,4817,Chest pain is probably due to tertiary contractions with some delayed emptying. Is it tender?
5723,1184,4818,How long has this calf been enlarged?
5724,1184,4819,Have you ever had D V T?
5725,1184,4820,Are you having any abnormal weight loss?
5726,1184,4821,What about any cold or flu symptoms? Any fever or chills?
5727,1184,4822,Any new aches or pains?
5728,1184,4823,"Have you had a cough, or coughed up any blood."
5729,1184,4824,What about shortness of breath while at rest or difficulty breathing with exercise?
5730,1185,4825,Let's talk about your family's medical history.
5731,1185,4826,Do you remember what her age was?
5732,1185,4827,I see. Anything else?
5733,1185,4828,Okay.
5734,1186,4828,Any fever?

5737,1186,4831,"Okay, any chest pain?"
5738,1186,4832,"Any shortness of breath, cough or cold like symptoms?"
5739,1186,4833,"No diabetes or thyroid problem, right?"
5740,1186,4834,Looks like you have no history of C V A or stroke.
5741,1186,4835,Everything else looks fine.
5742,1186,4836,"Your eyes, nose, and throat look good."
5743,1187,4836,How are you doing miss? How are your sugar numbers coming along?
5744,1187,4837,How are you checking it?
5745,1187,4838,Nice. Did you eat anything in the morning today?
5746,1187,4839,"Okay, let's see. We have an Accu Chek here in our office. I will do a quick sugar test for you, and this will be a fasting sugar test. It will be just a quick prick on your finger."
5747,1187,4840,Let's see what we got here. Your reading says one hundred and twenty. I will write it down for my record. Are you being active?
5748,1187,4841,Do you feel any tingling or numbness or any kind of cramps?
5749,1187,4842,Any kind of blurry vision?
5750,1187,4843,Any weight loss?
5751,1188,4844,How did your last visit go with the cardiologist?
5752,1188,4845,It looks like they diagnosed you with sick sinus syndrome. Do you have any questions about this new diagnosis?
5753,1188,4846,Great. So it looks like your past medical history is the same? Nothing new other than the sick sinus syndrome.
5754,1189,4846,"So Mister J, where do you stay?"
5755,1189,4847,"Oh yes, I have heard of it."
5756,1190,4847,How are you Mister James?
5757,1190,4848,"Oh, tell me what's going on with you?"
5758,1190,4849,"Hm, left leg pain?"
5759,1191,4850,Have you ever had an allergic reaction to drugs you've taken in the past?
5760,1192,4851,"Hey, do you smoke cigarettes?"
5761,1192,4852,Nope. Are you planning on quitting?
5762,1192,4853,Oh my God. No. It is bad. You should think about quitting.
5763,1192,4854,Where do you work?
5764,1193,4855,Are you still working?
5765,1193,4856,What was your profession?
5766,1193,4857,Nice. How did you enjoy the work?
5767,1193,4858,I bet. I have cousin who owns a car repair shop. He's almost always busy.
5768,1193,4859,"Any smoking, drinking, or hard drugs?"
5769,1193,4860,Great to hear.
5770,1194,4860,"Yes, I confirmed with his wife. He had a CABG done in ninety one. He has a history of radical prostate cancer for which he underwent a radical prostatectomy and nephrectomy.  
Guest_clinician: Any additional surgeries?"
5771,1194,4860,"Yes. He had lumbar surgery twice before. He suffered from lumbar stenosis many years ago in the sixties and seventies. He's actually due for another lumbar surgery with Doctor Y. He takes Percocet daily for his back pain.  He also has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia.  
Guest_clinician: I think I got it all down."
5772,1195,4860,Do you have any history of major surgeries?
5773,1196,4861,"Good morning, sir."
5774,1196,4862,"Before we begin, have you ever had surgery?"
5775,1197,4863,"Okay, so let's go over your medications. I'd like you to take these to help your muscle spasms."
5776,1197,4864,I've prescribed eight hundred milligrams of Ibuprofen to be taken every eight hours as needed along with Tylenol number three every six hours as needed.
5777,1197,4865,Tylenol number three is combined with Codeine.
5778,1197,4866,"And finally, I'm prescribing Methocarbamol seven fifty milligrams which needs to be taken four times a day for maximum relief. Do you have any questions for me?"
5779,1198,4867,"How are you doing today, sir?"
5780,1198,4868,How long have you been feeling this way?
5781,1198,4869,Has it been getting worse recently?
5782,1198,4870,What are your symptoms?
5783,1198,4871,What medications have you been taking for this?
5784,1198,4872,What other problems are you having?
5785,1198,4873,Has this improved at all?
5786,1198,4874,Have you been diagnosed with any conditions before?
5787,1198,4875,How was this treated?
5788,1198,4876,"It has been getting warmer recently, I don't think that this isn't necessarily a coincidence that you're having these symptoms now."
5789,1198,4877,"What else are you dealing with, sir?"
5790,1198,4878,Have you ever done that before?
5791,1198,4879,"If we've done it before, we can do it again."
5792,1198,4880,"Well, that's called P S A."
5793,1198,4881,"Sure, we can check your cholesterol too. I know you have history of it being high."
5794,1198,4882,"That's good, it's really hard to quit."
5795,1198,4883,Be sure to keep trying to quit smoking.
5796,1199,4883,"Hi, how's it going?"
5797,1199,4884,"It looks like the weather's been warming up, which is nice."
5798,1199,4885,"Aw, how many kids do you have?"
5799,1199,4886,"And are you single, dating, married?"
5800,1199,4887,"Congratulations! That's a decade, my friend."
5801,1199,4888,Are you from the area?
5802,1199,4889,How long-
5803,1199,4890,"Awesome. I moved here in O nine, so two years after you."
5804,1199,4891,"I'm originally from Kentucky. And I have to do the routine ask, but any drinking, smoking, or illicit drug use?"
5805,1199,4892,Got it.
5806,1200,4892,"Looks like the nurse came in and asked you everything. Ah, she has everything documented here, but I will ask one more time. So, tell me, where do you live?"
5807,1200,4893,Do you smoke?
5808,1200,4894,Do you work?
