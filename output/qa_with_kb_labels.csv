",none,none
39,"Did you fall on your back?
","No, I fell on my feet. Just kidding, I fell on my back.

",none,none
39,"Did you always have that pain? 
","No, I haven't. It comes and goes. 
",no,none
39,"Have you done anything to treat it?

",none,none
39,"I see. Did you start having problems with your balance after this? 
","No. I was still having problems with that before I saw the chiropractor.

",none,none
39,"It looks like you took Cipro. This is usually used to treat a U T I. Were you aware you had a U T I?

",none,none
271,"Yeah, it is. Sinusitis is the inflammation of your nasal airways. 
","I see. Thank you for describing it to me. 
",none,none
271,"No problem. Would you be able to describe to me what you had been feeling two to three months ago?

271,"Have you ever been prescribed any medication? 
","Here's the list of medicine I was taking. 
",none,none
271,"I see you were given antibiotics, correct? 
","I was, but I don't know what those are. Could you explain them to me? 
",none,none
271,"Antibiotics are usually used to fight infections. 
","I had an infection? I thought I just had some nasal problems. 
",none,none
271,"Your report states you had a severe infection. Do you remember if the antibiotics helped? 
","Not really. I felt like my symptoms were the same. 
",none,none
271,"I see. Did your doctor order any advanced imaging's? 
","Yeah. They did a C T scan of my nose. Here is the report from my C T scan. 
",yes,none
271,"Let me take a look. It looks like you had some thickening of the mucosal layer in your right paranasal sinus. You also had some obstruction in your right ostiomeatal complex and excess growing of some of the bones in your nose. Uhm. Oh, one more thing. I see your nasal septum was shifted to the left. 
","Oh, wow. Thank you for explaining everything to me. 
",none,none
271,"No problem. Going back to your list of medications, I know you took antibiotics for your infection, but did you take any medication for your sinuses? 
","No, I haven't. I did try this cream for my nose, but that didn't work either. Nothing worked! 
",no,none
271,"I see. Looks like the cream you used was a topical nasal corticosteroid. Are there any other symptoms that you have been experiencing? 
","I've had some trouble with my balance, and I feel like I've lost some of my hearing. I thought this was odd since I'm only fifty years old. I think my ears felt plugged or full of air, so they just needed to pop. 
",none,none
271,"I see. Let's perform an audiogram test to check your ears. 
","Sounds good. 
",none,none
271,"I'm seeing that you have some mild high frequency sensorineural hearing loss. Your tympanometry seems to be normal. Your speech discrimination was also normal.

271,"I want to ask a few more questions about your ears. Do you feel any fullness or pressure?  
","No, I don't feel anything like that right now. 
",no,none
271,"Do you hear any humming, buzzing, or roaring sounds?
","Nope. I don't hear anything like that. 
",no,none
271,"We checked your ears and now understand more about the problem, but I wonder why your balance is affected. When did you start noticing your balance was affected? 
","I think it could have been to this one medicine that starts with an A. I forgot the name, but it didn't really help my nasal problems. It just made my balance worse. 
",none,none
271,"Was the medicine called Allegra? 
","Oh, yeah. That's what it was called. I thought I had some sort of allergy, so I thought it would help. 
",yes,none
271,"I see. Did you ever feel any dizziness too? 
","Yeah, I did. 
",yes,none
271,"I will have you do some movements to see if your dizziness occurs.

831,"Did you ever receive any treatment for your binocular diplopia? 
","No. It spontaneously resolved and so I didn't need to seek any treatment. Back when all this was happening it had two episodes of a drooping eyelid. I thought I had myasthenia gravis but I was told that that was probably not the case.

","Yes. 
",yes,none
831,"When you look at objects off to either side of midline does it become worse?

","I tried physical therapy. They did a subacromion decompression treatment in November, two thousand and two.
",none,none
833,"Did either of those treatments help? 
","Not much. I went and saw Doctor Lin and he said that I might have a nerve fiber injury. I forget what he called it.  
",none,none
833,"Brachial plexopathy? 
","Yes. That sounds right. 
",yes,none
833,"Oh, I see his notes in your chart. It says that he felt like you had a right superficial radial neuritis and blocked this with resolution of your symptoms. Then it looks like he sent you to get E M G testing at Valley Medical. Let me look for those results. 
","Okey. They should be in my chart. I had Doctor Lin send over all my records. 
",none,none
833,"Here it is. It says that the right suprascapular neuropathy although a C5 radiculopathy could not be ruled out.  MRI testing on the cervical spine was then done which was negative for disk herniation and underwent suprascapular nerve decompression of the scapular notch on December eighteenth, two thousand and three.  
","Whatever that means? I ended up getting a nerve block because I was still in pain. Doctor Lin did one in the frount of my shoulder and then another in the back.

",no,none
868,"Did these symptoms start around the same time? 
","I think so. 
",none,none
868,"Where does your chest feel most congested? And how would you rate the pain right now? Ten being the worst.
","Both sides. I'd say it's at a three currently.
",none,none
868,"Does it send pain or numbness or tingling down your arms? How about any jaw pain as a result?

",no,none
868,"Is this your first time experiencing this type of congestion? 
","Oh no. I had something like it about ten months ago.  
",no,none
868,"Did that improve on its own?

870,"Do you happen to have a history of eye problems?

871,"Yes, I see on your chart that you were given ten centimeters of H two O nasal pressure and that you predominately suffer from hypopnea. Hypopnea is shallow breathing. How has the device been working?
","It definitely has reduced my snoring, but my partner keeps waking me up in the middle of the night because the mask pops off. I wear it around five to seven nights a week, but for some reason it falls off or I take it off randomly in the night. My wife usually must remind me to put it back on. 
",none,none
871,"So what is your sleep pattern now? When do you usually go to bed and wake up?
","Usually I sleep around eleven or eleven thirty and wake up at six or seven on the weekends. I'll sleep in until eight or nine on the weekdays. On Saturday's I might go to sleep around midnight because I usually watch a show with my family. I feel good when I wake up though. Much less tossing and turning. The sheets are always on the bed still. 
",none,none
871,"That's some good news. I see you have lost a bit of weight too. Around fifteen to eighteen pounds is something to be proud of. 
","Thanks. It has been a lot of exercising and dieting. I am motivated because I want to stop snoring. 
",none,none
871,"How has work been? Do you think it has been stressful at all?
","I still work at Smith Barney in downtown Baltimore. I work from around eight or eight thirty to five or five thirty. I deal with training on how to sell managed funds and accounts. I do not think I have been stressed because I am able to stay awake through my shift and even when I come home at night. I may get a little tired during hay fever season, but that is rare. 
",none,none
872,"Anything else?
","I have a lot of pain in my chest as well.

",none,none
874,"You are on blood thinners, right? That is Coumadin therapy? Or am I wrong here?
","No, you are right but please stop the Coumadin. I am tired of these regular blood draws.

876,"I see here that you have sleep apnea too. 
","Yeah, I was involved in an overnight sleep study on C P A P and oxygen.

","It was in order to determine why I had difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep.
",none,none
876,"Have You had any other treatments? 
","Yeah, I had a review done while I was in the hospital about two weeks ago, I have the results right here. 
",yes,none

","Um, I take pretty substantial doses of opioids in order to control it.
",none,none
876,"Do you have any swelling?
","Yes, I take Lasix for my leg swelling.
",yes,none
876,"How do you sleep with the C P A P?
","I can fall asleep with it, but I usually rip my mask off because I toss and turn.
",none,none
876,"How would you rate your quality of sleep?
","I'd, um, say it's pretty terrible.",none,none

882,"No, these headaches wake me up in the night. I haven't had a proper sleep in like ages. 
","Is there anything that elevates this pain? Or decreases it? 
",none,none
882,"Everything seems like increasing it. It just gets worse with coughing, straining, sneezing, even when I'm trying to stand. I tried all the medications, but nothing is helpful. There was Imitrex and I also tried Motrin eight hundred M G twice a day, but nothing seems to be like effective. Actually, it helps a bit when I lie down.
","Is it like specific to any particular area of your head?

",no,none
903,"Okay, I think we should do surgery in order to repair this ankle. 
","Why is that?
",none,none

","Okay, you're right. What are the risks of this infection with this surgery?
",none,none
903,"Overall, the risks of infection are less than one percent. We'll use antibiotics to keep everything clean.

",none,none
907,"That doesn't sound the least bit comfortable. Let's get you feeling better. Do you think it's related to your tooth? 
","No, I don't think so. I'm pretty good at making my dentist appointments, although I haven't been in since this new pain started.

","Yes sir. 
",yes,none
908,"Did the injections help at all?
","No sir, honestly, they did nothing. 
",no,none
908,"So, your finger is still locking today?

909,"Okay, so tell me what is going on with you?
","Oh wow. Can you tell me where exactly the pain is?
",none,none
909,"Um, it started from my neck and then moved up to the back of my head.

",none,none
909,"No.
","Okay, any nausea or vomiting?
",none,none
909,"I am having nausea, but it's coming and going but no vomiting. Also, I am not able to tolerate light at all.

",none,none
909,"No.
","Any fever? 
",none,none
910,"Okay, great. I've made note of it in your chart. I have one more question to ask regarding tobacco and alcohol. Do you smoke or drink?

",none,none
913,"Absolutely, sir, yes it is. 
","What kind of treatments have you had so far? 
",none,none
913,"Another doctor called it conservative treatment, um, I've taken antiinflammatories and had some injections. 
","Do you remember what kind of injections you've had? 
",none,none
913,"It was, um, cortisone, and Synvisc. 
","Did these relieve the pain at all? 
",none,none
913,"Well, it was only a temporary relief. Is there anything else we can do?
","Well, there is surgery for this.
",none,none
913,"What are the risks of infection from the surgery?
","Historically, it's less than one percent. 
",none,none
913,"How is this possible? 
","We use prophylactic antibiotics in order to eliminate the risk.
",none,none
913,"That's great, I've heard of D V T from the commercials, is there a risk for that?
","There's a risk, but it's low. Other risks are pulmonary embolism, need for further surgery, and further pain.
",none,none
915,"How is your strength and muscular pain? 
","They're both improving. 
",none,none
915,"Do you have any other complaints today?

","Um when I was at work this morning. It felt like something was in my eye. I went to the bathroom mirror to check it out, but didn't see anything. I flushed my eyes with water in hopes of it helping with the weird feeling.
",none,none
918,"Okay. Hm, are you experiencing any eye pain, blurred vision, or sensitivity to light?

",none,none
1097,"Does the pain go down your leg at all?

","Yes, I had to change my walking pattern to take weight off my knee, and I think that has to do with my back pain. 
",yes,none
1097,"That's certainly a possibility. How would you describe your pain? 
","I'd say its constant, shooting, cramping, aching, throbbing, feels like it's being pulled, sharp, and , um, stabbing. All of those words seem fitting. 
",none,none
1097,"Okay, does the pain wake you up at night? 
","Yeah, it does occasionally. 
",yes,none
1097,"Does anything make this feel better?

1098,"I believe you'd be a candidate for a bilateral L five kyphoplasty. 
","What's that? 
",none,none
1098,"It's a small procedure on that L five vertebra. Its minimally invasive, and we can actually do it as an outpatient procedure. 
","Oh, wow, that's good to hear. What are the risks of infection?

1098,"Very low, historically, they're less than one percent.

","Did you change some of you habits to help your bowels, ma'am?
