0,0,0,I came in for a refill of my blood pressure medicine.
1,0,1,No.
2,0,2,No.
3,0,3,I am seventy six years old and identify as a white female.
4,1,4,Terrible. I'm having the worst headache of my life.
5,1,5,Around eleven in the morning.
6,1,6,Um no yesterday. July thirty first.
7,1,7,Yeah.
8,1,8,I'm having blurry vision and lightheadedness.  I also can't seem to write well. It looks so messy. I am naturally right handed but my writing looks like I am trying with my left.
9,1,9,Like there are blind spots.
10,1,10,Um no. I feel like my face is pretty swollen though. I don't know if it's related to the headache but it started around the same time.
11,1,11,Thank. Will the nurse be in soon?
12,2,12,I think I have some warts on my back end where the poop comes out.
13,2,13,I think like three to four weeks ago.
14,2,14,"It itches a little, but I haven't felt any pain yet. Is this normal for a twenty two year old?"
15,2,15,Nope. Just the warts and itchiness.
16,3,16,"No, only the ones which were prescribed."
17,3,17,"No, only whatever is here in this prescription."
18,3,18,On as needed basis.
19,3,19,Which is a nasal inhaler.
20,4,20,I burned my hand.
21,4,21,Yeah.
22,4,22,Yes.
23,5,23,Much better. I don't know why I didn't take it with me everywhere I went.
24,5,24,Yeah. I think I've learned my lesson.
25,6,25,"No, I quit before I had my daughter."
26,6,26,"No, I'm not."
27,6,27,I actually had a C section.
28,6,28,I got my appendix out a few years ago.
29,6,29,No.
30,6,30,No.
31,6,31,No.
32,6,32,"It was about four or five years ago now, when I was in a car crash."
33,6,33,"They didn't recommend P T, and I didn't really have any increased back pain after the accident."
34,7,34,No.
35,8,35,Hello! I am good.
36,8,36,"My mother and father both had heart disease. Well, my mother had complication from her heart disease and that is how she passed.  My father was only in his forty's when he died."
37,8,37,"Thank you. I have two brothers, one whom I don't speak to very much anymore. I don't know if he has any health problems. My other brother is healthy with no issues. Both my uncles on my mother's side had polio, I think."
38,8,38,One of them had to wear crutches due to how bad his leg deformans were and then the other had leg deformities in only one leg.  I am fairly certain that they had polio.
39,8,39,No. None that I know of.
40,8,40,Yes. I have one child.
41,8,41,Yes.
42,9,42,"Sure, my brother has a prostate cancer."
43,9,43,My father had brain cancer.
44,9,44,Then on both sides of my family there are many heart related issues.
45,9,45,And my brother and sister both have diabetes.
46,9,46,"Yes, that's it."
47,10,47,"Good afternoon, doctor. Absolutely, that's no problem."
48,10,48,"I'm nineteen, sir."
49,10,49,"Yes, sir, that's correct."
50,10,50,I've had this bunion on my foot for such a long time.
51,10,51,"At this point, um, I don't even remember how long it's been."
52,10,52,"Actually, yes. I have a history of, um, Charcot Marie tooth disease."
53,10,53,"I would like to have surgery to cut this bunion off, I can't take it anymore."
54,11,54,"I'll be ninety later this month, doctor."
55,11,55,"Well, actually, my high blood pressure and right arm symptoms are basically gone."
56,11,56,"No, I'm not taking that right now."
57,11,57,"I didn't feel well at all, so I just went back to the old dose."
58,11,58,"Yes, doctor. I do think I could have some white coat high blood pressure. Doctors' offices make me nervous."
59,11,59,"What is this for, doctor?"
60,11,60,"I can't take these, doctor. They're too big. 
Guest_family: Hello doctor, I'm her daughter. Just so you know, we check her blood pressure at home periodically and it's always similar to that reading."
61,11,61,"Well, that pain is basically gone now, I think it had to do with that muscle problem back in my right shoulder blade."
62,11,62,"Yes, the tech brought me back right before you came in."
63,11,63,"What do they show, doctor?"
64,11,64,What makes you think there's an injury?
65,11,65,"No, none."
66,11,66,"I am having this stomach pain though, doctor."
67,11,67,"Well, it's improved somewhat with me not taking Aleve anymore."
68,11,68,"Right know, I'm just taking Tylenol as needed. That seems to be enough for me."
69,11,69,"No, but I take Tums, um, three times a day, and Mylanta at night. Oh yeah, I have these sores in my mouth, can you take a look?"
70,11,70,"Oh I couldn't even tell you, it's been many, many years."
71,11,71,"Yes, one will come, then it'll heal up, then another."
72,11,72,"And doctor, since I've been taking the Lexapro, I have some tremors on basically my whole body, at least the upper body, like my torso and arms."
73,11,73,"Yes, we think so."
74,12,74,"No, I don't believe in meds."
75,12,75,Yeah never.
76,14,76,I am forty four.
77,14,77,I'm right handed.
78,14,78,I don't know. I woke up over this numbness on my left side of the body. I remember it was on July twenty nineth.
79,14,79,I was able to walk and there was no weakness or any other thing you mentioned.
80,14,80,"There was nothing around Independence Day. It all started after that. At first, I felt that my right hand is very clumsy, and it is kind of stiff. Then I noticed leaning towards the right when walking. It was strange. Happened around July seventh."
81,14,81,No.
82,14,82,No.
83,14,83,No.
84,14,84,No.
85,15,85,"Yes, that is right."
86,15,86,"Yes, they did that."
87,15,87,I have had a hysterectomy.
88,15,88,Yeah.
89,16,89,I am twenty nine.
90,16,90,Yes. That is right.
91,16,91,"I think I was picking up a stack of cardboard, then putting it down on the ground and twisting to the right side. And sometimes I was throwing them a little bit as well."
92,16,92,"Around here, till waist level."
93,16,93,I heard a pop and since then there is pain in this area. I can't lift heavy items. Basically I have no strength.
94,16,94,"Yes, that's right. The pain is in the lateral part of the back of my shoulder."
95,16,95,Motorcycle accident.
96,17,96,About a few hours ago. I can't seem to stomach anything.
97,17,97,At least four.
98,17,98,Just nausea and vomiting. It's been so terrible.
99,18,99,"Good afternoon, doctor."
100,18,100,"Yes, she helps me out all day."
101,18,101,"Yes, can you give them to her, please?"
102,18,102,"Um, right now, I walk around at the mall to get my steps in every day."
103,20,103,"My asthma was acting up, and it felt like I couldn't breathe."
104,20,104,"Not that I know of, but I know I always get this really bad cough where I cough up some nasty phlegm."
105,21,105,"No, everyone in my family is quite healthy. I'm not aware of any medical problems."
106,21,106,"Yes, I am with my boyfriend."
107,21,107,"No, none of them."
108,22,108,Um there were a couple times where I noticed my blood pressure was high but that's improved as of late.
109,22,109,About a year ago.
110,22,110,"Yeah, my old doctor knows."
111,22,111,No not really.
112,22,112,Great.
113,22,113,None that I know of.
114,22,114,I lost my job last January and it took a pretty big toll on me.
115,22,115,I'm doing better now but I need to watch what I eat. I tend to eat a lot more when I'm stressed. It's something I'm working on.
116,23,116,"Yes, I am allergic to Penicillin."
117,23,117,Nope that is all.
118,25,118,Doc what are you going to diagnose me as?
119,25,119,"Yes, I was also thinking around contamination."
120,27,120,"Nope, no allergies for me."
121,28,121,I'm twenty four.
122,28,122,"I was out for fishing this weekend, I think I got into some poison ivy and I have these rashes all over my chest, legs, arms and also some are on my back."
123,28,123,"Oh yes, it has happened several times before. It usually takes some time to get over. Last time I was here Doctor Blackman gave me a steroid injection."
124,28,124,It worked fine. It did take us some time to get rid of it.
125,28,125,"I took over the counter Benadryl. Also, I'm applying cortisone cream on the rashes."
126,28,126,I saw a little bit of improvement. But this weekend it seemed to have been worst.
127,29,127,Skin cancer.
128,29,128,High blood pressure.
129,30,129,I feel this lump on the upper side of my breast.
130,30,130,"No, only on the left side."
131,30,131,Only on the outer side.
132,31,132,"Yes, I am new here. I have lived in Arizona for the last four years. I am from Maine. That is where I grow up and most of my family still lives there."
133,31,133,"I am a homemaker. I used to clean house, a while back."
134,31,134,I have two children but only one of them is still with us. My oldest son passed away from ulcerative colitis complications three years ago.
135,32,135,"Uh yeah, sorry. I'm just trying to adjust the stretcher."
136,32,136,"No, thank you. I think I got it."
137,32,137,"Fine, but I have this weird lump in my chest."
138,32,138,It's been there for a while. I'd say almost half a year.
139,32,139,"No, not until now."
140,32,140,Not really. It's just noticeable when I run my fingers over it.
141,32,141,No.
142,33,142,"Yes, very much."
143,33,143,Sure.
144,33,144,Nope.
145,33,145,Neither of them.
146,33,146,"Nope. I do leak, especially when I'm changing my positions like from sitting to standing so I do feel there is some involuntary urination. It's more like a urge. I'm loading data in like every one hour in the morning, especially when I take that Lasix."
147,33,147,It tapers off in the afternoon. And by the night I don't do not feel anything.
148,33,148,Nope.
149,33,149,Nope.
150,33,150,The stream is good. It does feel like all is out in one go. I do not have any kind of bowel issues. I'm using my vaginal cream. Sometimes I feel difficulty in doing so because I feel that there is still something coming out from the vagina and I'm afraid that there might be a prolapse.
151,34,151,"No, I haven't, you can ask my daughter."
152,34,152,No.
153,34,153,Yes.
154,34,154,Yes.
155,34,155,Yes.
156,35,156,I used to smoke a pack a day.  I quit that awful habit in nineteen eighty five.
157,35,157,I am retired.
158,35,158,Yes. We both are. I cannot imagine working a full time job at seventy six years old.
159,36,159,I am okay.
160,36,160,Thank you!
161,36,161,Correct! I am also seeing Doctor Y for my leukemia.
162,36,162,Yes.
163,36,163,That is correct.
164,36,164,For the past one week I am having this increased shortness of breath and having difficulty breathing from past few nights while sleeping.
165,36,165,And this morning I was having difficulty catching my breath. I am also having wheezing since morning.
166,36,166,No.
167,36,167,No.
168,36,168,Okay.
169,37,169,I just can't wait.
170,37,170,Bye Doctor.
171,38,171,"Fifty eight. I feel like my balance is off, and I've been feeling tired and weak."
172,38,172,It's been going on for six to eight weeks.
173,38,173,"I haven't, but this might not be related. I had pneumonia ten days before this all started."
174,38,174,"I did, but I don't know how to pronounce it. I wrote it down for you to read. Here it is."
175,38,175,"Yeah, that's right."
176,38,176,"Terrible. I felt like I couldn't control my body. My balance got even worse, and I felt even more tired and weak."
177,38,177,"I did fall recently, but I know for a fact my balance was off before my fall."
178,38,178,I think I was three or five feet high when I fell.
179,38,179,"No, I fell on my feet. Just kidding, I fell on my back."
180,38,180,"Not really, but I've been having some back pain in my lower and mid back."
181,38,181,"No, I haven't. It comes and goes."
182,38,182,I started to see a chiropractor like five days ago. He adjusts my neck and lower back.
183,38,183,No. I was still having problems with that before I saw the chiropractor.
184,38,184,"I was taking this other medicine for ten days, but I don't remember what it was for. Here is the name of the medication. I wrote it on another paper."
185,38,185,"Oh, yeah. I forgot about that. I thought I had one, so I went to another doctor to get some medication."
186,38,186,Nope. I feel like I'm able to go to the bathroom whenever I want.
187,39,187,Nope.
188,39,188,Nope.
189,39,189,Yes.
190,40,190,"Good morning, doctor. Yes, that's correct."
191,40,191,"Well, I punched a wall about three days ago."
192,40,192,It's my right hand.
193,40,193,"Unfortunately, yes, it is."
194,40,194,"Um, it's right here on the outside of my hand."
195,40,195,"I went to the E D, and they pushed some of the joints in my hand back, and they put me in a splint, so I've been wearing that ever since."
196,40,196,"Compared to when it started, it's much better today."
197,40,197,"Today, I'd say it's minimal pain."
198,40,198,"No, thankfully not."
199,41,199,"I am good, thank you."
200,41,200,Hello.
201,41,201,"Sure, no problem."
202,42,202,No.
203,42,203,"No, I don't know."
204,45,204,No nothing. No major illnesses.
205,45,205,Yes.
206,46,206,"Good morning, doctor."
207,46,207,Sure.
208,46,208,"Yeah, actually I've had it on my knee, a nose job, and, um, carotid sinus surgery."
209,47,209,"No, I am retired now. I used to work for the U S postal service as an electronic technician but took retirement one year earlier due to my disability."
210,47,210,"Well, I stay with my wife and daughter in our apartment."
211,47,211,No.
212,47,212,"I use to drink occasionally, that too very rare, but after my symptoms stated I stopped completely."
213,47,213,Nope.
214,47,214,"No, it's been really long since I traveled anywhere."
215,48,215,"I am good Doctor, thanks for asking."
216,48,216,"Oh sure, no problem."
217,48,217,Nice to meet you too.
218,48,218,Okay.
219,48,219,Sure.
220,49,220,I live in a board and care. It is a nice small care home with some very nice and supportive people. It is just next to the Safeway on Village Drive.
221,49,221,Oh yes. I feel very relaxed there.
222,49,222,No Sir.
223,49,223,Never in my life.
224,49,224,No. I have always kept myself away from all those things.
225,50,225,"Actually, yes, I had my gallbladder removed in nineteen ninety two."
226,50,226,"Oh yeah, I had my appendix out in nineteen eighty eight."
227,51,227,"I am feeling pretty fair, improving slowly."
228,51,228,Okay.
229,53,229,I have been feeling good. The Wellbutrin is working well for me.
230,53,230,I don't drink or do drugs.
231,54,231,My dad and grandpa both had type two diabetes. My son is struggling with type one diabetes at the moment.
232,54,232,No.
233,54,233,Two of my cousins had breast cancer.
234,55,234,"Well, you see, I am a civil engineer. Right now, due to pandemic like everyone else I am working from home."
235,55,235,"No, I can only work on half time. This disability does not let me work full time. I need to go to physical therapy quite frequently on and off and I also have a baby who consumes a lot of my time."
236,55,236,"No, I've never done any of them."
237,56,237,"Do you mean like B P, high sugar?"
238,56,238,"No, no one in my family has anything like that."
239,57,239,No.
240,57,240,No.
241,57,241,"No, not really."
242,58,242,No.
243,59,243,Yeah. Still a good amount of pain. I did not take my pain medication this morning though. Not sure if that will make a huge difference.
244,59,244,Yes. I am quite happy that I can do my daily activities. I can get up with minimal assistance and do many activities out of the house. I think I am gaining muscle from moving around more too.
245,59,245,I am loving pool therapy. I really feel like that is helping. I do the home exercises sometimes twice a day. I really want to get back to normal.
246,60,246,"Yes, I had knee surgery."
247,60,247,Right.
248,61,248,Yes.
249,61,249,Just one.
250,61,250,Yes.
251,61,251,He is a male. We have been together for three years. He is H I V positive.
252,62,252,I had a lymph node biopsy back in September of O three.
253,62,253,"Fortunately, yes."
254,63,254,I blame my heart. It's caused me the most trouble. I had coronary artery bypass surgery in twenty ten along with an angioplasty.
255,63,255,"Oh, and I forgot to mention that I've had prostate biopsies in the past."
256,63,256,Last year.
257,63,257,"Yes, fortunately. I guess my prostate isn't as troublesome as my heart."
258,64,258,"Let's see. I have diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and osteoporosis."
259,64,259,Several.
260,64,260,"I had my tonsils taken out when I was a kid. I also had my uterus removed along with my ovaries and fallopian tubes. The list goes on. I had my appendix removed and two or three of my parathyroids taken out. Despite getting some of my parathyroids removed, I still have borderline high calcium levels according to my endocrinologist."
261,64,261,No. I forgot to mention that I had two carpel tunnel releases as well.
262,65,262,My mother passed away from complications with Huntington Disease. She was diagnosed and had been having treatments at U I H C. My grandmother and two of my aunts also passed away from Huntington as well.
263,65,263,Yes! I have one sister. She is thirty eight. She has a lot of metal issues. She has attempted suicide two times.
264,65,264,No. Not really.
265,65,265,Yes.
266,65,266,Yes. We have two adopted kids.
267,66,267,My dad has lupus and his brother has Addison's disease. High blood pressure also runs in the family.
268,66,268,"Yes, he follows up with his rheumatologist pretty regularly."
269,67,269,What kind of exam?
270,68,270,I am on pain pills.
271,68,271,Yes. Oxycontin and Vicodin.
272,69,272,Okay.
273,69,273,I think that is correct.
274,69,274,"Yes, I take some multivitamins, but do I need to mention it?"
275,69,275,Okay.
276,70,276,"Oh, good morning, doctor."
277,70,277,"Well, right now, I live at home with my kids and my dad."
278,70,278,"Yeah, I can't use the stairs without holding the rail the entire time."
279,70,279,"Yeah, but I still move very slow."
280,70,280,"Yeah, I smoke about a pack to a pack and a half a day."
281,70,281,"No, I don't regularly workout, I've never been good at it."
282,71,282,My physician did a blood test. My potassium is high. He recommended me to meet you.
283,71,283,"Yes, that's what they told me."
284,74,284,"Thank you for asking, I identify as a female."
285,74,285,"No, but can you give me some examples of what you mean?"
286,74,286,"Oh, no, I don't have anything like that."
287,75,287,"What, like cancer?"
288,75,288,"Oh, I have allergies and asthma."
289,76,289,"Sure, my dad died of heart attack when he was sixty five and my mom died of stroke when she was seventy."
290,76,290,"No, my brother is healthy."
291,77,291,No one comes to mind.
292,78,292,And I feel the right side is drooping.
293,79,293,"Yes doctor, that's correct, I just had my birthday."
294,79,294,"Well, my cancer hasn't needed phlebotomies for several months now, which is good."
295,79,295,"Yes, that's the one."
296,79,296,"Yeah, having some independence is nice."
297,80,297,"Well, yes, but I can't remember who had what kind."
298,80,298,"That too, there's some history of heart disease, but I can't remember who."
299,81,299,What do you mean by that?
300,81,300,"Oh, um, no nothing like that."
301,82,301,I have type two diabetes. My numbers always come high.
302,82,302,I also have high cholesterol.
303,83,303,Great. I'm just here for my yearly physical.
304,83,304,"Uhm. Let me check my notes on my phone. I knew this question would pop up, but I always forget. Oh, perfect. You can take a look at them."
305,83,305,"If it's on there, then it's true. I usually don't remember these kinds of things. My wife is usually here with me. She knows all about my health."
306,85,306,I am taking Advair and Allegra.
307,85,307,"I don't know, I am not sure the Allegra is helping. But I do take them regularly."
308,85,308,"Yes, I think so."
309,85,309,Shall I continue?
310,86,310,No one.
311,86,311,"No, everyone is healthy."
312,87,312,It has been improving.
313,87,313,No.
314,88,314,"I don't want that, I will manage."
315,88,315,Yes!
316,89,316,No I don't remember.
317,90,317,Hi! I am good.
318,90,318,Thank you.
319,90,319,No.
320,90,320,I am not married but I do have a two year old son.
321,90,321,Yes. She is in Bartow.
322,91,322,My family is pretty healthy. I don't know of any health problems.
323,92,323,Thank you.
324,92,324,"No, I don't. Smoking is gross."
325,92,325,Yes.
326,92,326,When I get off work usually have a glass of wine. I don't ever have more then one glass.
327,93,327,Yes.
328,94,328,What kind of information?
329,94,329,Nope. My family is very healthy.
330,95,330,"Actually, I have a history of asthma."
331,95,331,"Well, it was not severe but still remarkable."
332,95,332,"Yes, I also struggled with a serious acne problem."
333,97,333,Ah! Have pain in my tooth.
334,97,334,"Oh, awfully bad."
335,98,335,No never like this.
336,98,336,Just some knee pain issues.
337,98,337,Yes.
338,99,338,"Yes, my sister has ovarian cancer, and my father has liver cancer."
339,99,339,That is okay.
340,99,340,My mom and dad both have heart disease. My dad has diabetes too.
341,100,341,You mean my heart problem and things?
342,100,342,"Okay, I have hypertension and kidney problems since many years."
343,100,343,I get frequent urinary infections.
344,100,344,Okay. I also have severe aortic stenosis.
345,101,345,"Well, my grandmother had it. She actually passed away due to brain aneurysm."
346,102,346,"Oh, it all started off with a little pimple on the buttock.  I was soaking it at home with hot water and stuff, but it did not improve. I hope this is not cancer. I am only twenty four."
347,102,347,I have pain.
348,102,348,Yes I was admitted to the hospitalist service with high blood sugars. My African American father was so scared.
349,102,349,"No, I do not know that but they found positive bacteria or some sort of thing in my blood culture."
350,102,350,Yes.
351,103,351,Oh no.
352,103,352,"Yes, I have been."
353,103,353,Okay.
354,104,354,No.
355,106,355,I am alright. I am here for a check up since I am feeling kind of dizzy lately.
356,106,356,A few months. This happened to my sister too. I think she is still dealing with it.
357,106,357,No. Not that I know of. The rest of my family seems pretty healthy.
358,107,358,No one that I know.
359,108,359,Okay.
360,108,360,Great!
361,109,361,"No, not taking any medications."
362,110,362,I've been better. Thank you.
363,110,363,That's right. I'm coming around between a month or two.
364,110,364,I'm not taking any medicine now. I just wanted to let you know.
365,110,365,"I think it was around four and a half years ago. I'm feeling much better after that. I do have complaints of blood in my stool. But after you sent me to that doctor, that gastro doctor, I feel good. I know they said that they removed something, but I'm not sure, but after that it has been improved a lot."
366,110,366,"Yeah, I agree. That was a relief."
367,110,367,"Yeah, I remember this said they removed something, but I forgot the name."
368,110,368,"I don't know. I feel a lot of fatigue and like I'm not able to do things like I used to do before. I get tired very easily. I don't know if it is related to something or not, but things have been weird. I'm not able to do even the minor things like I lift two boxes and I'm done for the day. Is it something that I should be worried about?"
369,111,369,"No, I feel great."
370,111,370,"No, it feels like I'm young again. I'm able to do all my activities."
371,112,371,I wish I wasn't here right now.
372,112,372,I'm seventy seven years young.
373,112,373,I'm an African American woman.
374,112,374,I've had this bunion on my foot for as long as I can remember.
375,112,375,"Yes, it is so painful, I've tried to avoid surgery for so long, but I want this bunion gone."
376,112,376,"I've used antiinflammatories, rested, changed my activities, I've done everything, but this pain is getting worse and worse.  I need it gone."
377,113,377,"Yes, I have hypertension but no diabetes."
378,114,378,"Oh no, I have no issues with my pain. Today I'm here for a different cause. I'm having this weakness all around on my left side, especially in my arm. I feel like I cannot lift anything like even a glass of water. It's hard for me to lift it up. I'm not able to walk properly, let alone the balancing and everything else. It's just that my whole left side seems to be weak."
379,115,379,"I have diabetes. Also, I was quite overweight."
380,115,380,"Yes, I was still taking something called Zyprexa, but I stopped it after my last regular weight check. Also, I never took anything for diabetes. I also have chronic bronchitis for… I don't know… many years."
381,115,381,"Oh yes, I am a smoker."
382,115,382,Maybe up to sixty a day.
383,116,383,"No, nothing like that."
384,116,384,"Um, no."
385,116,385,Nope.
386,117,386,"Good morning, doctor. Yes, that's correct."
387,117,387,I use my right hand for everything.
388,117,388,"Doctor, I've had years of pain in this shoulder."
389,117,389,"Well, um, I've had antiinflammatories, and rested, and none of it has helped so far."
390,117,390,"Yes, it certainly is. The pain is unbearable now."
391,118,391,"What, like a joint replacement?"
392,118,392,"Yeah, I've had an appendectomy and hysterectomy, actually."
393,119,393,"Absolutely, I'm sixty six now."
394,119,394,"Yes, and I have a few other problems today, too."
395,119,395,I'm having some right shoulder pain.
396,119,396,"No, not that I can remember."
397,119,397,It hurts when I move the shoulder.
398,119,398,"No, I don't have any of that."
399,119,399,"Well, I can only check it in the morning, and it's usually less than one hundred."
400,119,400,"No, doctor, I haven't been. When I check them, it's normal though."
401,119,401,"No, I don't have that with me today."
402,119,402,"No, I can't think of anything."
403,119,403,"No, I never had that done, I need to."
404,120,404,"None, that I know of."
405,122,405,"Oh, it's been about thirty five years now."
406,122,406,"Well, um, I've been taking insulin for about twenty years now."
407,122,407,"Yeah, um, prostate cancer."
408,122,408,"I've had radiation. Oh, my P S A is zero point zero one, by the way."
409,123,409,I feel an intense burning in my throat.
410,123,410,"It really hurts after eating food, especially junk food."
411,123,411,"Ah, yes."
412,123,412,"Absolutely, please, what does it show."
413,124,413,No.
414,124,414,"No, no vomit at all. No problem there."
415,124,415,No.
416,125,416,I'm sad and depressed.
417,125,417,My cancer came back.
418,126,418,I am having loose watery stools for more than two weeks now. I feel very lethargic. I also have pain in my tummy.
419,127,419,No.
420,128,420,I used to smoke. I quit in nineteen sixty eight.
421,128,421,I weighed myself this morning. I am at one hundred and eighty three pounds.
422,128,422,I used to be five foot ten but I think I have been shrinking.
423,128,423,Okay.
424,129,424,"No, I have never smoked in my entire life."
425,130,425,Thank you.
426,130,426,"I used to have seizures, but they have stopped now."
427,130,427,About seven years ago I had a traumatic stroke. They told me I had bleeding in the brain. After the stroke I was left with this weakness on my right side.
428,130,428,"My arm, hand, and my face."
429,130,429,My liver is falling. It is because of all the alcohol that I have consumed over the years. I am not drinking anymore.
430,130,430,No. I just stopped drinking. I think I have diabetes.
431,130,431,"I have been really thirsty, and I have been having numbness and tingling in my feet."
432,131,432,I am sixteen.
433,131,433,White.
434,131,434,No I have a really bad migraine.
435,131,435,"Here, since Monday."
436,131,436,"Yes, I am feeling a lot of pressure."
437,131,437,It is throbbing.
438,131,438,Nine or more.
439,131,439,No I haven't.
440,131,440,No no.
441,131,441,No.
442,131,442,No nothing like that.
443,131,443,No everything else is fine.
444,133,444,"I have a long history of lung disease. COPD to be exact. Recently, I was experiencing a lot of coughing and shortness of breath even on walking from one room to another. All the time I felt sleepy, tired, or confused."
445,133,445,It is getting better.
446,133,446,"I was also diagnosed with pneumonia; I was on trip and there they found it. It is also getting a lot better now, but doctor said to continue taking oxygen for some more time."
447,133,447,"With everything going on, I felt weak and tired and it looks like I have lost all my strength and muscle."
448,133,448,I also felt very instable and had a fall. I did not call for any assistance but now I think I should have called someone. Everyone including my family and nurses all tell me all the time to call for assistance. I was just being stubborn and hurt myself.
449,133,449,No.
450,134,450,"Oh, I have a list. I have asthma and sinus issues. I also had hives at some point and psoriasis."
451,134,451,I don't know of any.
452,135,452,I have a drink every once and a while.
453,135,453,I don't even drink that often. I probably have one drink per month.
454,135,454,I was engaged but that is not happening anymore. It is a long story.
455,135,455,I am a metal grinder.
456,136,456,"Never have, never will."
457,136,457,"Thanks. I'd like to think so, too. I have some friends who smoke weed, but stay clear of tobacco."
458,137,458,"No, I do not have any diseases."
459,137,459,Nope none.
460,139,460,Sure.
461,139,461,No.
462,139,462,"Um, no."
463,139,463,No.
464,139,464,No.
465,139,465,No.
466,139,466,"Not really, no."
467,139,467,No.
468,139,468,No problem.
469,140,469,I have seen worse days.
470,140,470,Hello Doctor Helm.
471,140,471,I feel nauseous.
472,140,472,I would say mild.
473,140,473,"No, only nausea is there. If I try to take deep breaths, then I still have pain."
474,140,474,It has been better now. I won't say I am all good but as I said I have seen the worst days.
475,140,475,No.
476,140,476,"No, none of them."
477,140,477,Okay.
478,140,478,No.
479,141,479,About forty five minutes ago. I think someone called nine one one shortly after it happened.
480,141,480,I was driving about forty miles an hour.
481,141,481,A minivan. The car in front of me stopped suddenly and I hit them right from behind. The front of my car is pretty wrecked.
482,141,482,Yes and yes.
483,141,483,"No, just me."
484,141,484,"No, but I do have some pain on the left side of my neck."
485,141,485,"Actually, I do. Right after the crash."
486,141,486,Um I'm having some pain in my lower stomach area. I think it could be due to slamming into the airbag or steering wheel.
487,141,487,Um I'd give it a five out of ten right now.
488,141,488,No.
489,141,489,"Uh no, but I guess I do have a little bit of pain in my pelvic area."
490,141,490,I don't think so. Someone told me that I was placed on the stretcher after they got me out of the car.
491,141,491,No.
492,141,492,No.
493,141,493,No.
494,141,494,No.
495,141,495,"No, I've been good at taking my birth control and I also have an I U D."
496,141,496,Um end of May I believe.
497,141,497,Accutane for my pimples.
498,142,498,No.
499,142,499,No.
500,143,500,I don't think so. My family has been pretty healthy. Both my parents died of old age.
501,143,501,I have one older brother. He's into weightlifting and all. I would say he's pretty healthy.
502,144,502,"Thank you for asking, they're both doing very well. They're very healthy."
503,144,503,"My mom is fifty, and my dad is forty."
504,144,504,"Yeah, I have two sisters, one is a half sister, and the other we have the same mom and dad."
505,144,505,"My half sister and I have the same mom, and she's thirty four. My other sister is ten."
506,144,506,"My half sister, um, no. My other sister has had some yeast infections."
507,145,507,I am seventy years old. I am here for nothing particular but I just have discomfort on the right side.
508,145,508,About five years ago. After my stroke. I've been to a neurologist before.
509,145,509,That sounds right. Nothing seems to help me to get rid of this discomfort.
510,145,510,I do it at home. Mainly two to three times a day. I increase or decrease the amount of insulin that I take based on my numbers.
511,145,511,It's been so many years now. I do it all by myself.
512,145,512,I used to chew tobacco a lot and then there were drinks. I used to drink at least half a bottle of single malt in one night. I quit everything five years ago after my stroke.
513,146,513,My arm is all better. It is not in pain at all anymore.
514,146,514,It's helping a little bit.
515,146,515,I am taking ten M G.
516,146,516,About a week ago. I don't take it every day. I don't feel like I need it some days.
517,146,517,Okay.
518,146,518,I didn't even notice.
519,146,519,No.
520,147,520,No.
521,148,521,It has been around twenty years.
522,148,522,Yes.
523,148,523,Yes. It was better for some years.
524,148,524,"They were at times, but eventually there was a new episode."
525,149,525,"Not anything specific but, many of my family members had lazy eyes."
526,149,526,My parents and my two little sisters.
527,149,527,"One is nine, another one is five."
528,149,528,They both are healthy.
529,151,529,It feels good.
530,151,530,No. I am good doc.
531,152,531,"Yes, for almost twenty two years now."
532,152,532,"Ah yes, I drive a delivery truck in the town."
533,152,533,I smoke about two packs a day.
534,152,534,"I drink three, oh wait, I drink two beers every day."
535,152,535,No.
536,153,536,"No sir, I'm happily single."
537,153,537,"I am a press worker, I work in a newspaper printing."
538,153,538,"No, none of them."
539,153,539,"I don't take any now. I was a heavy drinker, but I quit in the seventies."
540,154,540,Hm I don't think so. No reactions so far.
541,155,541,Yes I am taking thyroid meds and Lipitor.
542,156,542,"No, I don't remember any such thing."
543,156,543,No. No surgeries at all.
544,157,544,"Good morning, doctor. I'm thirteen."
545,157,545,"No, I don't have any of that."
546,157,546,"No, I'm very strong, especially for my age."
547,157,547,"Yes, doctor, everything is regular there."
548,158,548,"No, I am not allergic to anything."
549,158,549,Yeah.
550,159,550,"Yes, to my husband, I can't even remember how long my husband and I have been married."
551,159,551,"Absolutely not, I've never have used that stuff."
552,160,552,Family?
553,160,553,Nope.
554,161,554,"I was just trying to adjust cable that my brother's dog was tied to. All of a sudden, he attacked me out of nowhere. The injury to my leg is V shaped and the V is pointing towards my foot."
555,161,555,"German shepherd. But he is up to date on his shots, and he is completely healthy."
556,161,556,"He bit me on my foot, and it looks like his teeth went into my skin. I went to my P C P."
557,161,557,They cleaned the wound and did some bandage along with it he gave me a tetanus shot.
558,161,558,Yes.
559,161,559,Sure!
560,161,560,White male. I am fifty years old. Is my right leg going to be okay?
561,162,561,"Nope. Both of my parents, they died of old age. They were in their eighties. I cannot remember of any other medical issue in any of my relatives."
562,162,562,Nope.
563,162,563,Nope.
564,162,564,"Yeah, I have five children and they all are doing well in their life."
565,163,565,"What, like high blood pressure?"
566,163,566,"Oh, no, I don't have anything like that, at least not that I know if."
567,166,567,I'm ready as can be. This isn't my first rodeo.
568,166,568,"Yeah, I have. I think it's in my report that you have with you."
569,168,569,No. Not that I know of.
570,170,570,I am doing well. I start a new job on Monday. I have been unemployed for about a year now. It is going to be nice to get back to work.
571,170,571,"I used to smoke a little bit, but I quit ten years ago."
572,170,572,I don't drink or do drugs.
573,171,573,"Hm, my mother passed away due to cancer."
574,171,574,"Actually, I don't know that."
575,171,575,And my dad died due to heart attack.
576,171,576,Yeah.
577,171,577,"No, I don't have it. I moved here from a different country a long time ago with barely anything. I don't have any medical records from my past."
578,172,578,Thank you.
579,172,579,Yes. I believe the surgery is scheduled for July twentieth.
580,172,580,My shoulder is the same. I am still in a significant amount of pain.
581,172,581,I hope so.
582,172,582,"I have had some pain starting in that same spot, and it goes down the left arm into my wrist."
583,172,583,It is mild and it is about the same as the last time.
584,172,584,Yes. It has been the same.
585,172,585,"No, not really."
586,172,586,No.
587,172,587,No.
588,172,588,Yes. I can do that. I took the whole day off of work today.
589,173,589,None whatsoever.
590,176,590,Okay.
591,176,591,No.
592,177,592,"Right now, I'm a truck driver, sir."
593,177,593,"No, I can't right now, I'm on sick leave."
594,177,594,"Yes, to my wonderful wife. She's helping to take care of me."
595,177,595,"Yes, we have three. We all live together, and for that I'm very thankful."
596,177,596,"Yeah, I smoke about two packs a day."
597,177,597,"No, just smoking for me."
598,177,598,"Oh, absolutely not."
599,177,599,"No, not that I know of."
600,178,600,"I am good, thank you for asking."
601,178,601,"Well, I think I am suffering from memory loss, like short term memory loss."
602,178,602,I have been under tremendous stress for the last five to ten years. I am currently working for T mobile customer service and my work is really hectic. It requires a lot of technical knowledge with project deadlines which is adding to my stress.
603,178,603,Sometimes I have trouble absorbing all the technical knowledge and computer skills or customer issues.
604,178,604,"I did my M B A in business for a reason, I wanted to make a good career, but this job is very demanding and stressful. I previously worked at a bank in Conway Springs, Norwich. I have worked many jobs around accounting and management services, but my current job is a high stress one."
605,178,605,"I have been widowed for past eleven years. My husband died in a car accident, he was hit by drunk driver. It was not the time for my husband to go! After he left, I had to take care of everything and that's another reason for my stress from the past several years."
606,178,606,Yeah.
607,178,607,No.
608,178,608,No.
609,179,609,Thank you.
610,179,610,I am in a great deal of pain. It is coming from my left side right here.
611,179,611,Okay.
612,180,612,What do you mean?
613,180,613,"No no, oh no."
614,181,614,Yes.
615,181,615,Yes.
616,181,616,I will keep an eye on it.
617,182,617,I'm thirteen now.
618,182,618,"Yeah, I want to get back to playing sports with my friends.
Guest_family: I agree, Doctor, we'll do the surgery."
619,183,619,Um a number of different things. I don't even know where to start to be honest.
620,183,620,Lemme think. I'm uh having really bad pain.
621,183,621,"Hm. It's in a tricky spot. 
Guest_family: Hi. Husband here. Let me help explain. She's been having severe lower back pain. It started off mild and got worse over the course of a few days. She's also a lot more sluggish as a result."
622,184,622,It's bad whenever I try to stand straight. I also have these intermittent headaches where it feels like somebody is hammering inside.
623,184,623,No.
624,184,624,Many weeks now.
625,184,625,I used to smoke a hundred and even more packs per year. Now it's just one to two packs each day.
626,184,626,I lost forty pounds.
627,185,627,"Um, no."
628,185,628,Nope.
629,186,629,"Good morning, doctor, I'm twenty five."
630,186,630,"I'm okay, but I have this rash and itching over my right arm. It's so itchy and I scratch all the time."
631,186,631,"Yes, so this had especially been bothering me."
632,186,632,"Um, I think it was in October of nineteen ninety two. I think it was the twenty third."
633,186,633,"Um, yeah, I've had tingling in both my legs, like in the front, and then it goes into my toes too."
634,186,634,"Yes, it went away the next day without me doing anything."
635,186,635,"Well, two days later, so that'd be the twenty fifth, I noticed that my legs felt like they were asleep. I really couldn't feel anything."
636,186,636,"Yeah, I couldn't really feel anything in the middle of my chest. I also have started having pain in my right shoulder blade."
637,186,637,"Yes, I don't really feel comfortable standing on my own, and I can't walk very well."
638,186,638,"No, heat and cold don't bother me"
639,186,639,"No, not really."
640,186,640,No.
641,187,641,"Good, can't complain."
642,187,642,"Yeah, that's not a problem."
643,189,643,I keep having this dry cough and it gets hard to breathe at times.
644,189,644,Here's a note from a contractor that worked on my house recently. I wasn't sure what it meant.
645,189,645,"Oh, no! Am I going to be fine?"
646,189,646,"Nope. I live alone, so my family wasn't there to be exposed."
647,190,647,"Honestly, overall, I'm feeling a lot better."
648,190,648,"Yes, but I'm still feeling better though."
649,190,649,"Yeah, no problems there. I measured it like you told me to—six hundred M L."
650,190,650,"Um, it was about seven this morning."
651,190,651,"No, I feel pretty well."
652,191,652,No.
653,191,653,No. I was a boxer before so that's why I was always stayed away from these things.
654,191,654,Mostly I'm by myself during the daytime. Family comes to help with me on and off. I just love it that way. I wasn't to be in an independent home setting soon.
655,192,655,Yes.
656,192,656,"Yes, I have been in and out of treatment. I am not doing so well with staying clean."
657,192,657,"I drink, and I did some coke today. I have been in treatment for heroin and alcohol."
658,193,658,That's okay.
659,193,659,I am doing fine. I do get some headaches and it feels like somebody is ringing bells in my ears. My eyesight has improved a lot.
660,194,660,"Well, it's been about two and a half months now."
661,194,661,"Thank you for reminding me, I forgot the names of everything."
662,195,662,"Nah, no daily meds."
663,196,663,"No, he passed away a few years ago."
664,196,664,"Oh, it's quite all right."
665,196,665,"No, I don't do either of those."
666,196,666,I'm living at Kansas Christian Home.
667,196,667,"Yes, thankfully. But, I can't do a lot of things. I have to be sure to take my medicines."
668,196,668,"No, I had a driver today. Can we speed this up, I need to get to the noon meal."
669,197,669,Thank you.
670,197,670,I am good today!
671,197,671,I have been feeling nervous and having some anxiety lately.
672,197,672,It varies. I feel anxious when I think about retuning to work or this upcoming trip that I have planned.
673,197,673,It comes and goes.
674,197,674,No.
675,198,675,I live with my boyfriend.
676,198,676,"Yes, I do."
677,198,677,"Sometimes, but I don't want to talk about it."
678,198,678,Pardon?
679,199,679,"Good afternoon, doctor."
680,199,680,I'm forty nine.
681,199,681,"It was in January of two thousand five. What was the name of the surgery, again?"
682,199,682,"Truthfully doctor, the surgery did nothing. I'm still in a lot of pain."
683,199,683,"I have them written down, let me look. Um, I did acupuncture, T E N S unit at P T, and I've been to the chiropractor too."
684,199,684,"Yeah, I have those written down here. I've taken Elavil, Topamax, Cymbalta, Neurontin, and Lexapro."
685,199,685,"No, I had bad side effects to some, and the others just didn't do anything."
686,199,686,"I've had a few into the, um, piriformis."
687,199,687,"Um, it provided some brief relief, I guess. I had a Botox procedure done on March eighth two thousand six."
688,199,688,"Honestly, it did nothing."
689,199,689,"I'd say its seventy five percent in my butt and leg, and twenty five percent in my lower back."
690,199,690,"I've tried to increase how much I walk, but when I do I get spasms in my lower back."
691,199,691,I'd say it's a six out of ten today.
692,199,692,"Um, I'd say its shooting, sharp, and, um, aching."
693,199,693,"Well, lifting, standing for a long time, or, um, squatting. I can't do that anymore."
694,199,694,"Um, sitting back, ice, and I guess there's some improvement with the pain medication."
695,199,695,"It's constant now, but, um, the intensity of it comes and goes."
696,199,696,"Not really, it is affecting my sleep, which in turn affects my mood."
697,199,697,"Yes, doctor, that's correct."
698,200,698,"What exactly do you mean by that, doctor?"
699,200,699,"Oh, no."
700,201,700,Yeah. I take Abilify to help with my mood.
701,201,701,"A little, yeah."
702,202,702,Okay.
703,202,703,I will. Thank you.
704,203,704,I had a lung transplant in two thousand and four because of Pulmonary Fibrosis.
705,203,705,"Yes, both sides."
706,203,706,"Yes, I do."
707,204,707,"Look at this fifth fingernail on my left hand, doctor."
708,204,708,I think it's wood splinter.
709,204,709,Yes a lot.
710,205,710,"Sure, see. Like that?"
711,205,711,Great.
712,205,712,"Yes, no problems."
713,205,713,Okay.
714,206,714,"Yes, I am allergic to eggs and peanuts."
715,206,715,"No, nothing else."
716,207,716,No.
717,207,717,Sometimes I take a beer or two.
718,207,718,For last ten years.
719,207,719,I install floor. I am associated with a construction company and my main work is flooring installation.
720,208,720,"Yes, this is my mommy."
721,208,721,"What does that mean, doctor?"
722,208,722,"Yes, I have a lot of pain, doctor. 
Guest_family: What can we do about this, doctor?"
723,208,723,"Yes, I want to get back to playing sports with my friends."
724,209,724,Yes.
725,210,725,"I am. I've been traveling a lot, so I don't have a local doctor I usually see."
726,210,726,I've had this dark spot on my leg for a long time.
727,210,727,Not that I know of.
728,210,728,"Yeah, I have. I had surgery on my back and to remove my appendix."
729,211,729,Not as excited as you.
730,211,730,"Yeah. It was something with my chest. 
Guest_family: Hi Doctor. I'm the mother. He had a chest port placement."
731,212,731,I live with my boyfriend.
732,212,732,Yes.
733,212,733,Around ten years.
734,212,734,"Well, one pack of cigarettes lasts for around three days."
735,212,735,I do take beer.
736,212,736,I take around six bottles once a week.
737,212,737,I was working in a herbicide plant. There were so many layoffs because of this pandemic. I lost my job too.
738,213,738,Okay.
739,213,739,"Yes, I do."
740,213,740,I had both chickenpox and measles when I was a kid.
741,214,741,Okay shoot.
742,214,742,Yes to both.
743,214,743,"Yes, I do."
744,214,744,"Yes, I do."
745,216,745,"I used to chew tobacco, but I quit when I was thirty seven."
746,216,746,I take one glass of wine every day.
747,216,747,"Yes, sir. I'm married to a wonderful woman for last thirty five years."
748,216,748,"I used to. Now I'm retired, I was a lab manager before."
749,217,749,I came back because I increased my methothrexate as we discussed the last time I was here. A few days later I started getting multiple canker sores in my mouth. They hurt.
750,217,750,"No. It is painful to eat with the sores, but I still have an appetite."
751,217,751,No.
752,217,752,Okay.
753,218,753,No.
754,218,754,"No, I'm not aware of anything like that."
755,220,755,"Yes, I do take two or four beers in a day."
756,220,756,"Oh yeah, I'm a smoker. I take around one to two packs of cigarettes each day."
757,221,757,I wouldn't say I live alone. I have three cats and they always keep me company.
758,221,758,Two Persian cats and one Chartreux.
759,221,759,I retired a few months ago. I used to work as a psych aide for the State of Pennsylvania.
760,221,760,Thank you.
761,221,761,Thirty two years.
762,221,762,"I drink wine every now and then. I used to smoke back in the day, but I'm five years smoke free. I do not do drugs."
763,223,763,"Good morning, doctor. Sure, that's no problem."
764,223,764,"Yes, that's right doctor."
765,223,765,"Um, I've had six, I'm here for a follow up today."
766,223,766,"Yes, I remember that. Can you remind me the full name of my cancer?"
767,223,767,"Thank you, doctor."
768,223,768,"Well, I just have some numbness in my right upper arm today."
769,223,769,"Well, no, not really."
770,223,770,"No, there's no numbness there."
771,223,771,"No, thankfully no."
772,225,772,"Yes, um, I know some of my relatives have had coronary artery disease, and, um, high blood pressure."
773,225,773,"No, that doesn't ring any bells."
774,226,774,"Um, if I recall, it was on November twentieth two thousand eight."
775,226,775,"I work at the Purdy Correctional Facility, doctor."
776,226,776,"Well, an inmate broke some of the overhead sprinklers, and I slipped on all the water and I landed on the back of my head, and then onto my back."
777,226,777,It was mostly on my left side.
778,226,778,"Well, I was pretty stunned, mostly. I didn't want to come in, but my employers asked me to just to be sure."
779,226,779,"Um, I went to Gig Harbor Urgent Care, and then they sent me to Tacoma General Hospital. At Tacoma they said I have a whiplash and concussion."
780,226,780,"Um, they did a C T scan, and they found a dark spot on my brain."
781,226,781,"They said I should have another M R I and they diagnosed an, um, recurrent acoustic neuroma."
782,226,782,"I used to see a chiropractor, and they suggested that I get a scan and that's how they found it before."
783,226,783,"Um, it was in October of two thousand five."
784,226,784,"Yes, I'm recovering now."
785,226,785,"Yes, it's under consideration but there's no final decision yet."
786,226,786,"You know, the usual, adjustments and massages, stuff like that."
787,226,787,"Overall, my spine pain has improved a lot."
788,226,788,"I went to Prompt Care in Bremerton, and saw Doctor X Y Z. She's an osteopathic doctor."
789,226,789,"She ordered an M R I of my neck, I have the report right here."
790,226,790,"Yes, she released me back to full duty. I was doing fine after the neurosurgical treatment."
791,226,791,Some radiation.
792,226,792,"Oh, you know, just general aches and pains on my back and neck. I have been seeing her since two thousand and two."
793,227,793,"Nope, none that I can think of."
794,228,794,Yes.
795,228,795,"Ah yes, I got a tear in my retina."
796,228,796,That's correct.
797,228,797,"Yes, I am on anticoagulants."
798,229,798,No.
799,230,799,"Um, yeah, my dad had prostate cancer."
800,230,800,"Um, my mom's brother had Hodgkin's disease, melanoma, and prostate cancer."
801,231,801,"Not really, no."
802,231,802,No.
803,231,803,I like to go on walks with my dog every day. I'm also eating a lot healthier these days.
804,231,804,I actually got promoted last month so it's been going well. I've had a lot more time to spend with my family as a result.
805,231,805,Thank you so much.
806,232,806,"No, I do not have any allergies."
807,233,807,I work as a phlebotomist and respiratory therapist.
808,233,808,I am fifty four.
809,233,809,Thank you!
810,233,810,"So, as you remember I was trying to measure blood gas as I was working with a patient and I accidently jammed that needle inside my right hand index finger."
811,233,811,I am coming for regular screening.
812,233,812,"Yes, I had gloves and protective clothing."
813,233,813,"Yes, he got negative HIV but positive Hep C."
814,233,814,I am scared.
815,234,815,Yes actually.
816,234,816,They checked my urine and blood too.
817,234,817,I got albuterol nebulizer treatment too.
818,234,818,"No, it did not."
819,234,819,It is okay.
820,234,820,"Yes, Ampicillin and Cefotaxime."
821,235,821,"I had my tonsils removed when I was a kid, maybe around eight. I was hospitalized for the heart attack in ninety six. They did some surgery to check how my heart is functioning and then they did a bypass I guess."
822,235,822,"Oh yes, I got it with me. Here it is."
823,235,823,"Yes I had so many surgeries, it's hard to keep a track of all those complex names. That's why I keep those papers with me all the time if I go to any new doctor."
824,236,824,"My mom, dad and siblings are good."
825,236,825,Yes.
826,237,826,"I work at A B C store, doctor."
827,237,827,"No, I don't smoke at all."
828,237,828,"I'd say I drink socially, like if I'm at a party, or something."
829,238,829,Nope.
830,239,830,"Good afternoon, Doctor, my knees are in a lot of pain today."
831,239,831,"Um, the left knee hurts more than the right, but there's pretty significant pain with both."
832,239,832,"Yes, I can walk like, maybe a half a mile a day, then the pain gets too bad."
833,239,833,I have to take them one at a time.
834,239,834,"Yes, but what does that mean?"
835,239,835,"Ah, yes."
836,239,836,"Um, I had surgery on both of these knees, let me check my notes. It was an, um, arthroscopy."
837,239,837,"They were in the nineteen ninety one nineteen ninety two time frame, somewhere in there."
838,239,838,"I've taken antiinflammatories, had injections, and I've even used narcotics."
839,239,839,Can we do both at the same time?
840,239,840,"I've had a lot of back surgeries, I have spinal stenosis."
841,239,841,"Let me check my notes, um, I've had a spinal decompression and epidural steroids injection."
842,239,842,"The pain is so bad, but Doctor X has handled those."
843,240,843,Yes.
844,240,844,Two cigarettes per day.
845,240,845,Okay.
846,240,846,"No, I don't drink."
847,241,847,"Well, you told me to follow up if my cough doesn't get better. Also, I started having several other issues."
848,241,848,Yeah.
849,241,849,It's about the same but not getting better.
850,241,850,No more diarrhea and no pian.
851,241,851,Normal.
852,241,852,No pain and no problem emptying my bladder.
853,241,853,"Nope, but I have developed this weird sore taste in my mouth."
854,241,854,Since last week.
855,241,855,"No, not really."
856,241,856,"Yeah, I am also having some trouble with my eyes, I am able see fine, but it feels kind of funny."
857,241,857,"And then my back is hurting so much, and last week my right shoulder and neck started to hurt."
858,241,858,No.
859,242,859,"Right now, I'm working with Chevron as a petroleum engineer."
860,242,860,"Um, I'd say I drink socially, like if I'm at a party or something."
861,242,861,"No sir, I don't do that."
862,243,862,No. My husband and daughter seem to be doing okay. They haven't complained of anything yet.
863,244,863,"I'm good, thank you. I'm having this weakness on my left side after the brain, I mean, after they removed my tumor from the brain."
864,244,864,It was on October twenty fourth last year.
865,244,865,I'm sixty four.
866,244,866,"He is my husband, Al."
867,244,867,They asked me to go to the physical therapy for all the problems I was having after my brain surgery. I went from November fifth to the fourteenth of last year. I did therapy for around two weeks starting on November fifth. My problems were not solved so I went to the hospital and then they did some tests and they found out something was wrong. They said there is swelling in my brain so they admitted me there and then I had my second surgery.
868,244,868,It was on December fifth. I was there in the rehab the whole time and then I was discharged for home one month after my second surgery.
869,245,869,I took Nexium.
870,245,870,Yes.
871,246,871,"Well, I am doing okay. I am getting treated for hemorrhoids. I am also having some constipation from the past few weeks and I have recently developed this cough which is okay as I kind of get it often."
872,246,872,Yeah.
873,246,873,"No, it's fine."
874,246,874,"Well, just prune juice."
875,246,875,"Nah, I am not bothered by it."
876,246,876,"Um, no I am fine."
877,246,877,No.
878,246,878,"Well, I am doing okay! Sometimes if I have pain, I take Tylenol and usually it works for me."
879,246,879,Yeah.
880,246,880,Yes.
881,246,881,Right.
882,246,882,No.
883,246,883,Yeah.
884,246,884,No.
885,247,885,"Of course, Hello doctors. 
Guest_clinician: Hi Miss Dey."
886,247,886,"Well, last week I had some urine issue, like had to pee frequently. I had few episodes of urgency."
887,247,887,This week it's much better I am not feeling like how I was feeling last week.
888,247,888,I feel no urgency or inconsistency and I am able to empty my bladder completely.
889,247,889,"However, I do leak some pee when I cough. I wear pads daily."
890,247,890,"I don't think it changed much, it feels almost the same."
891,247,891,"Yes, all good there, no issues."
892,247,892,Nope!
893,247,893,"Yes, I feel both have worsened. I am able to walk on uneven surface most of the time. But I feel I have become very slow."
894,247,894,Yes.
895,247,895,Yes.
896,247,896,"No, no cane."
897,247,897,"Ah yes, in the beginning of May, I got a spell of severe cough and because of continuous coughing I think I developed pain in my hip which travels down to my legs."
898,247,898,Yes! I feel constant tingling sensation and a feeling that something is pinching my never. Sometimes it's just so painful.
899,247,899,Often I feel like my legs have become like elastic. I feel this tingling sensation is the reason my walking has become slower.
900,247,900,"No, I think I told you everything."
901,247,901,Bye!
902,248,902,"Yes, seven days back. I went to get my blood work done and then I followed up with Doctor Y."
903,248,903,"I will follow up with my oncologist, Doctor Z, for my swellings."
904,248,904,Okay I will do that.
905,248,905,And you want me to see my gastro doc too?
906,248,906,Sure thing.
907,249,907,Yep.
908,249,908,It's all under control for now.
909,249,909,Yeah.
910,250,910,Diabetes.
911,250,911,Type two.
912,250,912,Yeah. I'm also trying to manage it with exercise.
913,251,913,"Oh yes, I am using it. I have also started going back on my regular walk."
914,251,914,Yeah.
915,252,915,"Hi Doctor, I am good."
916,252,916,"Well, I am having nausea and I just want to get it checked."
917,253,917,"Past three weeks, doc."
918,253,918,Nah.
919,253,919,Nah.
920,253,920,None of that.
921,254,921,Okay.
922,254,922,Back in the nineteen forties. I also had an ankle resection in nineteen seventy five.
923,254,923,Uh nope.
924,254,924,Yeah. Started around age twenty and stuck with me ever since.
925,254,925,Once every five years or so.
926,254,926,Uh I'm usually given antibiotics and then discharged.
927,254,927,"Unfortunately, I've had more episodes in the past year than ever before."
928,254,928,Not to my knowledge.
929,254,929,Yes. I had a catheter placed for urinary retention. He told me he thinks it's due to an enlarged prostate.
930,254,930,Uh no. I've lost about eighteen pounds in the last month but other than that everything else seems to be fine.
931,255,931,I am feeling okay.
932,255,932,No. I feel better now.
933,255,933,No.
934,255,934,No.
935,255,935,No.
936,256,936,No one in my family has any health problems.
937,258,937,"No doctor, this is new."
938,258,938,I feel like my tongue is swollen.
939,258,939,I am fifty four years old.
940,259,940,Sure.
941,260,941,"Yeah, I feel much better."
942,261,942,Yes. Penicillin.
943,262,943,Okay.
944,262,944,Yes.
945,262,945,"Yes, I am taking quite a few. I always carry the list of my medications, let me tell you the names.  Yeah, so I take Dilantin for my seizures, Toprol for my high blood pressure and Pravachol for my cholesterol."
946,262,946,Sure.
947,263,947,Nope. No surgeries.
948,263,948,Nope.
949,264,949,I have pain in my jaw since the morning.
950,264,950,Not that bad.
951,265,951,"Do you mean prescription, or over the counter?"
952,265,952,"Oh, I haven't taken anything in the past."
953,266,953,I've been following the A D A diet online and maxing out at around eighteen hundred calories per day.
954,266,954,A lot better actually. My blood sugar isn't as high as it used to be.
955,267,955,I am doing okay.
956,267,956,I was diagnosed with stage three ovarian cancer two years ago. They found a tumor in my upper abdomen. I had surgery and they removed everything. Doctor King is my oncologist.
957,267,957,Yes.
958,267,958,Have a heart murmur. It has not been an issue. I also have acid reflux.
959,267,959,Yes. I take omeprazole.
960,268,960,I'm forty two years old and identify as white.
961,268,961,"That's right. Oh, man. My asthma has been getting worse over the last three months. My allergies are also acting up again."
962,268,962,"Well, my husband has been hauling more corn in since it's busy season. I think that might have made it worse."
963,268,963,"I'm using my inhaler every day for my asthma. Here are the other medications and treatments I've been using. I know I wouldn't have remembered, so I put them on a paper for you to see."
964,268,964,Eh. It kind of helps when I do take it.
965,268,965,Nope. Only when I feel like I need to.
966,268,966,"I'm not taking that right now, but it helped me in the past."
967,268,967,"I did, but I stopped taking it because it started to annoy my private area."
968,268,968,"Oh, yeah. I feel like I'm easily annoyed right before my period. It could also be my husband, but he likes to say it's because I'm about to start my period."
969,268,969,"Yeah. I feel like I've seen an increase in all the signs before my period. I'm also getting more impatient around that time, but when I'm not on my period, I feel like my mood is better."
970,268,970,"My husband says it's bad the week before I start my period, but I think it gets better a day after I start."
971,268,971,Not as much anymore. Just some spots here and there.
972,268,972,Nope. I feel fine most of the time.
973,268,973,"Yeah, that's correct."
974,268,974,Nope.
975,268,975,"I actually just had some lab work done because it was required for a life insurance application. Crazy, right? Here's the form with all the details for the lab work."
976,268,976,Of course. I'll get that sent to you A S A P.
977,269,977,"Well, doctor, I've lost both of them now."
978,269,978,"Thank you, doctor. Both of my brothers are doing very well."
979,269,979,"One of them is sixty eight, and the other is seventy seven. I'm in the middle."
980,269,980,"Well, I'm not sure if it counts, but I had a brother and sister, they were twins, they died at birth."
981,269,981,"Yes, I thought it would be important."
982,269,982,"Yes, I have two sons, they're both doing very well."
983,269,983,"One of them is fifty four, and the other is fifty seven."
984,269,984,"Yeah, um, a lot of my family has diabetes, and a lot of them have had heart attacks as well."
985,270,985,I was referred by a doctor to come see you so that you could check up on my nasal problems. Here is my report from my previous doctor who referred me to you.
986,270,986,Is that what they're calling my nasal problems?
987,270,987,I see. Thank you for describing it to me.
988,270,988,"Yeah, I can. My face would feel uncomfortable, my nose was stuffy, my eyes hurt, and I felt something dropping in the back of my throat."
989,270,989,Here's the list of medicine I was taking.
990,270,990,"I was, but I don't know what those are. Could you explain them to me?"
991,270,991,I had an infection? I thought I just had some nasal problems.
992,270,992,Not really. I felt like my symptoms were the same.
993,270,993,Yeah. They did a C T scan of my nose. Here is the report from my C T scan.
994,270,994,"Oh, wow. Thank you for explaining everything to me."
995,270,995,"No, I haven't. I did try this cream for my nose, but that didn't work either. Nothing worked!"
996,270,996,"I've had some trouble with my balance, and I feel like I've lost some of my hearing. I thought this was odd since I'm only fifty years old. I think my ears felt plugged or full of air, so they just needed to pop."
997,270,997,Sounds good.
998,270,998,That's reassuring.
999,270,999,"No, I don't feel anything like that right now."
1000,270,1000,Nope. I don't hear anything like that.
1001,270,1001,"I think it could have been to this one medicine that starts with an A. I forgot the name, but it didn't really help my nasal problems. It just made my balance worse."
1002,270,1002,"Oh, yeah. That's what it was called. I thought I had some sort of allergy, so I thought it would help."
1003,270,1003,"Yeah, I did."
1004,270,1004,Sounds good.
1005,270,1005,"Oh, wow. That made me very dizzy."
1006,271,1006,My wife lives at home with me.  She can help me change my bandages.
1007,272,1007,"Yeah, I am. I forgot what the surgery was, but it says it in my report."
1008,273,1008,I had knee replacement for both my knees three years ago and now I am having some pain.
1009,273,1009,Both.
1010,274,1010,Hello!
1011,274,1011,I am feeling okay.
1012,274,1012,"Yes, I think so too."
1013,276,1013,"Hello, nice to meet you. Of course. Um, what can I say? I am a recent widow. My husband passed when we were married for only eight years. I am also retired and loving every minute of it."
1014,276,1014,"No, I do not smoke. I drink occasionally, but it is very rare."
1015,276,1015,I have three wonderful children.
1016,277,1016,I use my Albuterol inhaler.
1017,278,1017,Yes.
1018,278,1018,I would say yes.
1019,279,1019,"Yes, I take um two point five M G once a day."
1020,280,1020,No.
1021,280,1021,"No, I've never done it."
1022,280,1022,Nope.
1023,281,1023,I've been having headaches for a while now.
1024,281,1024,"Um, I had my first one about two months ago."
1025,281,1025,"Um, I'd say it was more gradual."
1026,281,1026,"Right here, between my eyes."
1027,281,1027,I'd say it feels like a pressure sensation.
1028,281,1028,"Um, they're about moderately severe, I guess."
1029,281,1029,"Yes, they do. My regular activities are significantly more difficult now."
1030,281,1030,"Yeah, I do. I also have some light sensitivity."
1031,281,1031,"Yes, I have a very stressful job, doctor."
1032,281,1032,"Well, no not at all. I even try to have a little drink before bed, and it doesn't help."
1033,281,1033,"No, nothing like that."
1034,282,1034,"No, not that I know of."
1035,282,1035,"No, it's not ringing any bells."
1036,283,1036,I am having stomach pain.
1037,283,1037,"Yes, both."
1038,284,1038,No.
1039,284,1039,No.
1040,285,1040,"Good afternoon, doctor, thank you for asking, I identify as a female."
1041,285,1041,"Yes, I actually had an A C L reconstruction done in March of two thousand eight. Um, it didn't go well, so they did a revision at the end of that year, in December."
1042,285,1042,"Actually, yes, I had surgery on my arm when I was six."
1043,286,1043,Thank you.
1044,286,1044,I am professor at the college up on the hill.
1045,286,1045,I teach history and the bible.
1046,286,1046,No. I do not partake in either of those activities.
1047,287,1047,"Yeah, I have a history of thyroid problems, actually."
1048,287,1048,"Oh yes, that's right too."
1049,289,1049,Sure. I just came into the hospital I think about three weeks back for recurrent urine infections.
1050,289,1050,Yes that is why they put catheter in me.
1051,289,1051,"Yes, because of my heart problems they had to put pacemaker in."
1052,289,1052,I have hereditary diabetes.
1053,289,1053,That's right.
1054,289,1054,"Yes, because of my stroke."
1055,289,1055,"Yes, for my hypothyroidism."
1056,289,1056,Yeah.
1057,289,1057,"I have had many surgeries. They took out my gall bladder, then colon cancer surgery was in nineteen ninety eight."
1058,289,1058,"Yes, that is correct."
1059,290,1059,"No, there's nothing of note."
1060,290,1060,"No, not that I know of."
1061,291,1061,"Um, no it's just me."
1062,291,1062,Yes.
1063,291,1063,Oh yeah first time it shot up this high. I never had a high blood pressure problem before.
1064,292,1064,"Actually, yes, I know a few family members have, but I can't remember who had what kind."
1065,292,1065,"Yes, that rings some bells."
1066,292,1066,"I know that a lot of my family has had arthritis in the past, but I can't remember whether or not they had joint replacements, honestly."
1067,293,1067,"I am good, how about you?"
1068,293,1068,"Um, I have developed this painful ulcer on my hip."
1069,293,1069,On my right hip.
1070,295,1070,I am in pain. I get these frequent episodes of pain and discomfort in my head.
1071,295,1071,Sometimes it is overall and other times just on any one side.
1072,296,1072,"Hi, doctor. Yes, this is my mom."
1073,296,1073,"Yeah, mommy, I thought I needed it, but you didn't give it to me."
1074,297,1074,"Good afternoon, doctor. I'm fifty two years old."
1075,297,1075,"Yes sir, that is."
1076,297,1076,"Right now, I'm a temporary employee for A B C A B C, I've worked for A B C D, too."
1077,297,1077,"Mainly, I handle the loading and unloading of furniture and appliances for people's houses."
1078,297,1078,"It was about two and a half weeks ago now, back in October."
1079,297,1079,"Yeah, I've had back pain for a long time."
1080,297,1080,"I was unloading one of the A B C eighteen wheelers, when I bent down to pick up some boxes, and I felt the pain."
1081,297,1081,I felt a sharp pain in my lower back right away when I tried to lift those boxes.
1082,297,1082,"Yes, it goes into the right side of my butt, and then all the way down the outside of my right leg, like into the knee."
1083,297,1083,"Doctor, they've only gotten worse."
1084,297,1084,"A little, not as bad as the right."
1085,297,1085,"The muscles in my butt are spazzing, and it's happening more and more."
1086,297,1086,"Yes, I saw Doctor Z at first."
1087,297,1087,"He gave me some muscle relaxers, and some, um, Lidocaine patches."
1088,297,1088,"No, not at all."
1089,297,1089,"I saw doctor X Y Z too, through worker's comp."
1090,297,1090,That was back in April.
1091,297,1091,"Um, he sent me for an M R I, and I have the report for that right here."
1092,297,1092,"Yes, he gave me some opioids."
1093,297,1093,"Doctor X Y Z put me on restricted duty status, doctor."
1094,297,1094,"He told me that, but I still have pain, so I went back to see him."
1095,297,1095,"Yes, I did."
1096,297,1096,"He referred me to a Pain Clinic, and he recommended I have, um, epidural injections with doctor A B C."
1097,297,1097,"Yes, I did."
1098,297,1098,"No, it did absolutely nothing."
1099,297,1099,"I had an M R I, um, E M G, and nerve conduction study with doctor A B C D."
1100,297,1100,"Yes, doctor, they're right here."
1101,297,1101,"Well, anything like sitting for a long time. When I do that, I feel it in my legs."
1102,297,1102,It's really on my right.
1103,297,1103,"No, sir, I'm not able to sleep at all."
1104,297,1104,"Well, I went back to work in June, after doctor X said I'd reached the maximum medical improvement we talked about."
1105,297,1105,"Yeah, I saw doctor X about eight or nine times."
1106,297,1106,"Really, no, it did not. I still have the pain down my legs today."
1107,298,1107,"I have a whole list. See, my grand aunt had a stroke. My M G had heart issues same as my mom, who died of a heart attack at sixty three. My father had some sort of cancer. I don't know what exactly. And my sisters have blood pressure issues."
1108,298,1108,"No. Well, that is one thing that skipped my family."
1109,301,1109,"Yes, I do, multiple."
1110,301,1110,I have them all written down on this.
1111,302,1111,"No, no, and no."
1112,303,1112,I think I am better.
1113,303,1113,No I don't.
1114,303,1114,I think it's all better.
1115,304,1115,I am good.
1116,304,1116,Can I go home now?
1117,304,1117,Thank you!
1118,305,1118,"Yes, doctor."
1119,305,1119,"Yeah, my brother has been doing this too. 
Guest_family: We had some chicken one day, and then we had more of it the next day. After they ate it they started to feel bad and still feel bad."
1120,305,1120,"No, I haven't today."
1121,305,1121,"Yes, I peed this morning."
1122,305,1122,"Yeah, I had half a hamburger and some milk last night."
1123,306,1123,I have high blood pressure and macular deterioration. Last year I caught pneumonia but that has cleared up.
1124,306,1124,I have had this cough and pain on the right side of my abdomen.
1125,306,1125,Two days. I have had body aches and have been feeling nauseous too.
1126,306,1126,I think so. I was chilled and my forehead was warm. The cough is a dry sounding cough.
1127,306,1127,Yes.
1128,307,1128,I'm fourteen years old.
1129,307,1129,My left knee hurts really bad.
1130,307,1130,"Well, since the fall of two thousand seven."
1131,307,1131,"Mom, can you tell the doctor?
Guest_family: Yes, actually, we went to another orthopedist in November of two thousand seven."
1132,307,1132,"P T only made the pain much worse, it hurts so much.
Guest_family: Yes, she's in a lot of pain, is there anything else we can do, besides P T?"
1133,307,1133,Will I be asleep for this?
1134,307,1134,Will I need to go back to P T?
1135,307,1135,"Yeah, I think so too, I want to get back to playing soccer.

Sp 3"
1136,308,1136,I have pain in my tummy.
1137,308,1137,It started suddenly around noon.
1138,309,1138,Thank you.
1139,309,1139,I have been struggling with pain and stiffness in my right neck and shoulder.
1140,309,1140,Maybe for about four months.
1141,309,1141,It has been getting worse. The pain is worse at night. It wakes me up at night. I haven't had a good night sleep in four months.
1142,309,1142,"Yes! About two weeks after the pain started, I was having some numbness and painful cramping in these two fingers here."
1143,309,1143,Yes.
1144,309,1144,I am forty six.
1145,309,1145,Right. It was a throbbing pain in my hand.
1146,309,1146,I few times I had some numbness in both of my legs. It started with a pinching from my tailbone area.
1147,309,1147,"No. I don't know where this pain came from. Oh, every once and a while I have this electric shock like sensation shooting down my spine when move my neck certain way."
1148,309,1148,No.
1149,309,1149,No.
1150,309,1150,No.
1151,309,1151,I have been taking Naprosyn.
1152,309,1152,Only a little bit.
1153,310,1153,"Yes, this is baby number two."
1154,310,1154,I've been pregnant two times in total. No miscarriages or abortions.
1155,310,1155,About a month ago.
1156,310,1156,Pretty normal.
1157,310,1157,"No, fortunately they've all been normal."
1158,310,1158,I haven't gotten one before. Do I need to get one? I just turned thirty nine. What's the recommended age again?
1159,311,1159,"Okay, I will make an appointment today."
1160,312,1160,I've been checking my blood sugar one to two times a day.
1161,312,1161,"Uh yeah, but I need to be better at it."
1162,312,1162,"Yep, in fact it's right here. Let me grab it for you."
1163,312,1163,Here ya go.
1164,312,1164,Do I need to fast for it again?
1165,312,1165,That sounds like a good plan.
1166,312,1166,Much better. No more headaches and a stuffy nose.
1167,313,1167,My back started hurting last night. I have a stomachache. I have had pain with urination for the last two days.
1168,313,1168,I just started coughing and now I have a fever.
1169,313,1169,Yes.  I had kidney stones less than a year ago.  I had a urinary tract infection at the same time.  It was awful.
1170,315,1170,"Oh, I have high blood pressure but it's well under control. I make sure to keep it under normal range."
1171,315,1171,"Yeah, I have history of high triglycerides. But otherwise, I am pretty healthy."
1172,315,1172,No.
1173,316,1173,"Hello, doctor. Yes, I have been told that both eyes need cataract extraction. I came for a second opinion because I will only have surgery if necessary. I am nervous."
1174,316,1174,I am not exactly sure because the other doctors said a bunch of medical terms. I have had laser in my eyes though. That was for macular degeneration. Doctor X said I had neurovascular age-related macular degeneration.
1175,316,1175,No. I just know laser was done by Doctor X four times to the macula on the right and two times on the left.
1176,317,1176,Um yeah. I'm trying to remember the name. It's a pain killer that starts with an L. Oh Lortab.
1177,317,1177,Really bad hives. I've only ever taken it once.
1178,318,1178,"No, none that I know of."
1179,319,1179,Thank you.
1180,319,1180,I work in Human Resources for the State of Maryland.
1181,319,1181,I live alone.
1182,319,1182,I used to smoke like a chimney. I quit smoking a while back. I had been smoking for about sixteen years.
1183,319,1183,I quit in nineteen eighty four. That is also the year I quit drinking.
1184,319,1184,I had a drinking problem. I am in A A. I have been in A A since I quit.
1185,319,1185,Thank you.
1186,319,1186,"Yes. I used to take pills, but I never got into needle drugs. Thank God.  I went through treatment, all those years back. I started going to A A and got my life together."
1187,319,1187,No. I had my last H I V test over two years ago. I have been with the same guy for over two years.
1188,320,1188,"Both of my parents were healthy, but my maternal grandfather had a stroke."
1189,320,1189,"No, not that I know."
1190,321,1190,"What do you mean by that, doctor?"
1191,321,1191,"Oh, yeah, I have a few things like that. I have anemia, high cholesterol, and, um, hypothyroidism."
1192,322,1192,"Oh, I am fifty eight now."
1193,322,1193,Yeah. Okay. It all started a year ago. It started with losing the color in my vision.
1194,322,1194,Gradual. And now I am starting to have blurry vision.
1195,322,1195,I noticed it two months ago.
1196,322,1196,It is an all over vision blur and then I have on blind spot in my right eye.
1197,322,1197,Some days I feel like things are a little better but not much. I have basically been the same.
1198,322,1198,No.
1199,322,1199,No.
1200,322,1200,No.
1201,322,1201,No. Just the vision problems.
1202,323,1202,I have been having some trouble breathing.  I had tightness in my chest after walking up stairs.
1203,324,1203,"Sure, I'm fifty six years old."
1204,324,1204,"Well, I have a history of systemic lupus erythematosus."
1205,324,1205,"Um, I went to a rheumatologist about four months ago, I had discomfort in both of my hands."
1206,324,1206,My left was worse than my right at that time.
1207,324,1207,"Um, I came in on October thirtieth two thousand seven. I was having the same problem."
1208,324,1208,"They have me a trial of Elavil because they thought it was, um, ulnar or radial neuropathy."
1209,324,1209,"Yeah, they gave me a prescription for Zostrix but I couldn't fill it because of my insurance."
1210,324,1210,"Yeah, especially here, at the base of my left hand, like around my wrist."
1211,324,1211,"Right here, doctor."
1212,324,1212,"Um, actually yeah, I've been having some respiratory problems for the last three days or so."
1213,324,1213,"Um, I've had a dry cough and I feel like I've had a fever but I haven't taken my temperature."
1214,324,1214,"No, not that I can remember."
1215,324,1215,No.
1216,324,1216,"Thankfully, no."
1217,325,1217,"I have two, but I do not remember their name or why I am taking it."
1218,326,1218,"Okay, how this will be helpful?"
1219,326,1219,My mom dealt a long time with anxiety and stress disorder.
1220,327,1220,Ready when you are.
1221,327,1221,Both my parents have high blood pressure.
1222,327,1222,Um yes. Oh they also have E T.
1223,327,1223,No.
1224,327,1224,Hm. Give me a second to think. Does lupus count?
1225,327,1225,My cousin.
1226,327,1226,Uh mom.
1227,328,1227,"Oh, I take Flonase."
1228,328,1228,No I do not.
1229,329,1229,"I have stayed relatively the same. My main complaint is that I feel tired throughout the day. The C P A P is doing fine and I wake up refreshed, but I don't like how I crash."
1230,329,1230,I seem to be fine. My thyroid gland does not seem enlarged and I can breathe like normal. No fever or anything.
1231,329,1231,Nothing of the kind.
1232,329,1232,It has been stable.
1233,329,1233,"No, nothing like that. Not bad for forty five."
1234,330,1234,"Yes, I did."
1235,330,1235,Yes. It happens whenever needles are involved.
1236,330,1236,I feel normal today.
1237,331,1237,I am not so good.
1238,331,1238,"Well, I have lot of swelling in my legs."
1239,332,1239,Hi! It's nice to meet you.
1240,332,1240,I have had this pain in my finger and wrist for about a month. I have had some numbness too. The numbness started in the finger and is now in the wrist too.
1241,332,1241,"The left one and the middle finger, here."
1242,332,1242,It started when I woke up and then by the end of the day my wrist was numb too.
1243,332,1243,A few days after the numbness started.
1244,332,1244,I am left handed.
1245,332,1245,I am a cook. I also cut the fish for the whole restaurant.  I cut fish for hours in the mornings and it has been a struggle and it is aggravating my finger and wrist.
1246,332,1246,I am forty four.
1247,332,1247,No.
1248,332,1248,No.
1249,332,1249,No.
1250,333,1250,"I feel good, considering.  I slept well last night."
1251,333,1251,No. I feel fine.
1252,334,1252,I'm good. It's hard when you are in quarantine. I hope things will get back to normal soon.
1253,334,1253,"Yes, it was due for so long."
1254,334,1254,Yeah.
1255,334,1255,"No, I don't feel any pain."
1256,335,1256,"She's doing well, thanks for asking. Oh yeah, the remodeling has been a lot. I didn't think it'd take as long as it has."
1257,335,1257,"Yeah, it's two weeks away. I've been jogging and doing cross country track about five times a week. I also lift twice a week on my better days."
1258,335,1258,Nope.
1259,335,1259,"Pretty darn well actually. I go into the allergy and immunology clinic four days outta the week. I like that my hours are flexible. My patients also haven't run away from me yet, which is always a good sign."
1260,336,1260,"Yes, I just had my birthday, doctor."
1261,336,1261,"Yes, that's right, sir."
1262,336,1262,"Well, I don't really have a single acute complaint, but I have a muscle sprain in my upper back."
1263,336,1263,I think it has to do with me lifting weights.
1264,336,1264,"No, it's not really."
1265,336,1265,"I'm a housekeeper, it's my profession."
1266,336,1266,"Yes, it's not severe, but I'm having some trouble."
1267,336,1267,I'd say it's usually a two out of ten.
1268,336,1268,"When that happens, I'd say it's a three or a four."
1269,336,1269,Over the counter medications usually help the pain go away.
1270,336,1270,"No, just this muscle pain."
1271,336,1271,"No, my strength and everything is normal there."
1272,336,1272,"No, I don't have anything like that."
1273,337,1273,I have been having irregular periods.
1274,337,1274,My last period was on June first two thousand and four.
1275,337,1275,No! There is no possibility that I am pregnant.  I have not had sex in two years.
1276,337,1276,I was ten years old when I got my first period.  My cycle has never been regular. It runs in my mom's side of the family.
1277,337,1277,My mom and my aunt have both had total hysterectomies.
1278,337,1278,I see Doctor X Y Z Allen for my abnormal heart valve condition.  I am on S B E prophylaxis.  I have to limit my activity because of my heart condition.
1279,337,1279,Yes.
1280,338,1280,My right leg is in a lot of pain. The nurse just changed the bandage. I only have a rash where the bandage is.
1281,338,1281,"The pain medication is horrible. I have been throwing up, off and on. I have been constipated since I have been here."
1282,338,1282,Thank you.
1283,338,1283,No.
1284,338,1284,"No. Just a rash where the bandages are like I said earlier. I also want to discuss this acne while I am here. I have had it for about two years. It's nothing big, just mild to moderate in severity."
1285,339,1285,"No, not to my knowledge."
1286,340,1286,"Well, I used to a long time ago, but I don't anymore."
1287,340,1287,"Well, my wife and I have a drink or two a day."
1288,341,1288,"No, nothing major."
1289,341,1289,I had a little curve in the spine. It was not major. Doctor said that it can be corrected by exercises.
1290,342,1290,"Yeah, I have chronic diarrhea, and C O P D."
1291,342,1291,"Yes, I have been for a long time."
1292,342,1292,"Um, I'd say it's pretty heavy."
1293,343,1293,"Yes, rhythm problem is bad."
1294,343,1294,Yes. I do.

1299,345,1299,One was forty years old and the other was forty five.
1300,345,1300,"Thank you. It's been really hard on my family, but we're trying our best to get by."

1304,345,1304,Never.
1305,346,1305,"No, sir."
1306,346,1306,"No, no heart disease."
1307,346,1307,No and for that I'm thankful.
1308,347,1308,My dad had Alzheimer's disease. He is in a facility that cares for him now.
1309,347,1309,"It is. My aunt, his sister helped me get everything set up for him. She had a stroke last month."
1310,347,1310,She is home now but her husband is having to help take care of her. The doctors said it looks good for her to have a full or almost full recovery.
1311,347,1311,"Yes, it is!"
1312,347,1312,No not that I know of.
1313,348,1313,"I've got about three weeks left, sir. Twenty five days, if you want to be exact."
1314,348,1314,"Absolutely, I don't want to go back."
1315,348,1315,"No sir, absolutely not."
1316,349,1316,"Yes, that's okay."
1317,349,1317,"My mom has lumps in her breast but it is benign, however my granny on my father side had cancer."
1318,349,1318,"Well, it was breast cancer don't know if there are types for it."
1319,349,1319,What do you mean by that?
1320,349,1320,"Oh, got it. No, I never had that."
1321,349,1321,No.
1322,349,1322,"No, nothing like that."
1323,349,1323,"Yeah, I recently got treatment for my sinus."
1324,350,1324,"Uh yeah, but I quit in two thousand seven."
1325,350,1325,"Uh if I were to guess, I'd say one pack per day."
1326,350,1326,"I used to do coke, but I quit that in two thousand five."
1327,350,1327,"Um I used to drink one pint per day, but I quit drinking more than ten years ago."

1339,353,1339,"What? 
Guest_family: My mother is hard of hearing. She is eighty five. They found her on the toilet."

1341,353,1341,I don't know.
1342,353,1342,I don't know.

1382,367,1382,"Three nights ago, I fell on my steps bringing in the groceries from the car."

1385,368,1385,"No, do you have those in today?"
1386,368,1386,"Yes, I got it when I worked at a hospital after graduating."
1387,369,1387,Okay.

1390,370,1390,I take Ibuprofen for body aches from time to time but that's it.
1391,371,1391,"Yes sir, that's correct."
1392,371,1392,"Well, I work at A B C, and about two days ago I slipped on some oil that had spilled."
1393,371,1393,"I fell with both my arms outstretched, but I fell mostly on my left shoulder."
1394,371,1394,"Mostly, it's in the back of my shoulder."
1395,371,1395,"It hurt really bad yesterday, but that's gone away now."
1396,371,1396,"No sir, I don't have anything there."
1397,371,1397,"No, it's not really weak at all."
1398,371,1398,"Um, overall, I'd say it's gotten better. I have a little better range of motion."
1399,371,1399,"I was able to get in the swimming pool with my kids, and I didn't really have any trouble."
1400,371,1400,I've just taken some Advil so far.
1401,372,1401,"Hi Doctor.  
Guest_family: Things have been pretty good. She has been having some new emotional outbursts. I made an appointment with the down syndrome behavioral specialist that you recommended from the last time we were here."
1402,372,1402,Yes.
1403,373,1403,"Good afternoon, doctor."
1404,373,1404,"Actually, yes I have. I had pinning surgery done on both of my ears."
1405,373,1405,"Um, I was five or six years old. It was when I was a kid, I know that for sure."
1406,374,1406,Not that I know of.
1407,375,1407,My dad has high blood pressure. My mom has had a ton of skin cancer removed.
1408,375,1408,I have no idea.
1409,376,1409,"Yes, of course."
1410,376,1410,I have been coming to you for the last fifteen of my seventy eight years on Earth. I know how a follow up works.
1411,376,1411,"No, luckily I do not have that."
1412,376,1412,"No. I can't really feel my heart beat normally, but I guess that is better than feeling it beat constantly."
1413,376,1413,Sleeping has been fine. I sleep through the night.
1414,376,1414,None. I don't have shortness of breath at any other time of the day.
1415,376,1415,No. No swelling.
1416,377,1416,It's nice to meet you as well.
1417,377,1417,Thank you.
1418,377,1418,"Yes, I feel like I've tried everything in the book and I still can't break the habit. One of my buddies was telling me about this medicine called Clantix or something like that."
1419,377,1419,"Okay, great. Since moving back home, I've ran out of Xanax."
1420,377,1420,Almost a year now. I usually take it on days where my anxiety is really bad.
1421,377,1421,"Yes, I need to find a new cancer specialist that's closer to where I live."
1422,377,1422,"Not at the moment, but I do get pain when I eat sometimes. Other times it's when I'm not even doing anything. It's been chronic so nothing new."
1423,377,1423,I haven't in a while.
1424,377,1424,About six or so months ago.
1425,378,1425,"No, I am not allergic to anything."
1426,378,1426,Hm.
1427,379,1427,Thank you. It is nice to meet you.
1428,379,1428,"I am from Denmark. I speak Danish as my first language. Me and my husband have been in the States for many many years. When we first got here, we did not speak a word of English."
1429,379,1429,Thank you.
1430,379,1430,I just turned seventy four last month.
1431,379,1431,Thank you.
1432,379,1432,Is that the water on brain thing?
1433,379,1433,"Then, yes."
1434,379,1434,I think I have been walking funny lately. I have also been losing my balance.
1435,379,1435,My husband noticed that I have been walking funny. He noticed it about over six months ago or so.
1436,379,1436,"No. 
Guest_family: I must help her get in and out of the car. Not every time but sometimes. I am very concerned because she has been falling more and more recently."
1437,379,1437,I have had one emergency room visit.
1438,379,1438,"I fell. I was walking to the bedroom. I lost my balance so I put my hand out to brace myself against the wall and my hand slipped. I fell on my wrist. 
Guest_family: She broke her wrist."
1439,379,1439,"March two thousand and seven.
Guest_family: She has fallen a few times since she broke her wrist. It makes me so nervous."
1440,379,1440,No. I never get headaches.
1441,379,1441,"Yes, I guess so."
1442,379,1442,I am still able to pay the bills on time. I don't feel as smart as I used to be.  I do feel like my thinking has slowed down over the last few months.
1443,379,1443,I have not fainted. I have had some dizzy spells in the past but not recently.
1444,379,1444,No.
1445,379,1445,No.
1446,379,1446,Okey.
1447,380,1447,"Yeah, I feel much better, I read about my condition and it is called something as um refraction or--"
1448,380,1448,Oh yeah that!
1449,380,1449,Yes.
1450,380,1450,"Yes, I made an appointment last week, um, no week before that, but I completely forgot about it."
1451,380,1451,"Yes, I will do it today."
1452,380,1452,"Okay, I will do that. Thank you!"
1453,381,1453,No.
1454,382,1454,I am doing well.
1455,382,1455,I have been doing well. I have been able to keep it within that range.
1456,383,1456,"Well, no I'm not. My husband and I got a divorce."
1457,383,1457,"It's okay, it was for the best. Yes, I have two."
1458,383,1458,"Yeah, um, I live with my son right now."
1459,383,1459,No I do not.
1460,384,1460,"Well, I'm having a lot of headaches, I feel it in my face."
1461,384,1461,"That, and I have the sniffles."
1462,384,1462,"Um, well, last night I had a sore throat, and I was coughing up phlegm."
1463,384,1463,"Um, I've had a rash on my face, back, and arms for the last three days or so."
1464,384,1464,"Yes, so we've been taking a lot of Benadryl."
1465,384,1465,"I have been, there's been a lot of fifth disease this year."
1466,384,1466,"No, I haven't been."
1467,384,1467,"No, I haven't had anything."
1468,385,1468,"Yes, I had a partial removal of my ovaries and then I also had my appendix removed."
1469,385,1469,"Yeah, I also got my tummy tucked."
1470,386,1470,"Hello, doctor."
1471,386,1471,"I'm thirteen, sir."
1472,386,1472,I sliced my right ring finger with a piece of glass while I was playing around with my friends.
1473,386,1473,"You're right. I have a lot of, um, numbness and tingling in it."
1474,387,1474,Not so well. I went to a party last night and my chest and body have been hurting a lot.
1475,387,1475,Nope. I never smoked in my life.
1476,387,1476,Like my upper right side of my stomach area.
1477,387,1477,"I had to drive some people home, so I was sober. I also don't like the taste of alcohol, so I stay away from it."
1478,388,1478,And do I have to restrict my movement or activities?
1479,388,1479,"Got it. Thank you, Doctor. Do I need a follow-up?"
1480,388,1480,Alright then bye.
1481,389,1481,My dad had stomach cancer.
1482,389,1482,I think he was seventy something. My sister has breast cancer. She is in her fifty's.
1483,389,1483,No. Not that I am aware of.
1484,390,1484,No I don't. I have to care for my daughter. She is a widow.
1485,390,1485,"Yes, she lives at home."
1486,391,1486,I think I need help.
1487,391,1487,"I am having mood swings, sometimes I feel super happy and sometimes I am just super sad and angry with myself. I find myself in tears thinking about things or situations which are not even real."
1488,391,1488,I have just completed five decades of my life.
1489,391,1489,"No, that thought never came to my mind. I just feel sad, like nobody cares if I exist. Sometimes I feel I can conquer the world and do anything I put my heart and mind into. It's just that I am not sure how will I feel after an hour."
1490,391,1490,"It has been going on for many months. At first, I ignored everything but now It feels like I am not myself any more with all these mood swings."
1491,391,1491,"Yes, I am a hygienist and work in a Bright Dentals."
1492,391,1492,"Huh, my symptoms have sure started affecting my work. You know what the worst part is, my boss came to me last week and asked if I was on some kinds of drugs. I literally shouted at her saying no and left the clinic in tears. I think I need some drugs; I mean some medications to deal with my issues."
1493,391,1493,"Yeah, I was on Wellbutrin before. It was prescribed by Doctor Jonah. I was eating a lot and even gained like twenty pounds in just a few months. My insurance didn't even cover it, I had to pay from my pocket."
1494,391,1494,"It is all in these papers, I got my file with me, I just want to be normal me again."
1495,391,1495,"Yes, I was doing better once I started taking that medicine regularly. I continued it even though I had to pay out of my pocket."
1496,391,1496,No.
1497,391,1497,No.
1498,391,1498,"Sometimes I really find it hard to concentrate. As a hygienist I really need to focus on the gums of the patients and cleaning but sometimes it gets hard to focus. Normally, at work I just stop when it gets hard to focus and take a walk around the clinic. It has started affecting my work. I need help!"
1499,391,1499,"Oh yeah, the insomnia, I am hardly sleeping. At times I feel like a zombie."
1500,391,1500,"Yeah, I had some complications and they had to remove my complete uterus along with tubes and ovaries."
1501,391,1501,In the December of two thousand and three.
1502,392,1502,I have high blood pressure.
1503,392,1503,"Yeah, I remember I also had higher number of fat in my blood."
1504,393,1504,"Good morning, doctor. Yes, this is my first time in."
1505,393,1505,"I'm fifty five, doctor."
1506,393,1506,"Well, I'm having a laundry list of symptoms coinciding with my allergies."
1507,393,1507,"Well, my sense of taste is diminished, dry mouth, um, acid reflux, and G I issues, and then I have asthma, and reactions to things like aerosols."
1508,393,1508,"Um, I think."
1509,394,1509,Both my parents are deceased.
1510,394,1510,Thank you. My dad passed away at seventy five from leukemia and my mom fell victim to heart problems and alcoholism at thirty eight.
1511,394,1511,One of my uncles on my dad's side was recently diagnosed with leukemia.
1512,395,1512,No.
1513,395,1513,No.
1514,395,1514,I had vomiting a few times.
1515,395,1515,No.
1516,395,1516,"No, on the contrary I am having constipation every now and then, it's really bothering me now. I feel bloated all the time and don't feel fresh in the morning or throughout the day."
1517,395,1517,Couple of months now.
1518,395,1518,No. I use suppositories.
1519,395,1519,Okay!
1520,395,1520,"No, not really. I do get this twisty pain in my stomach sometimes which I think is mainly due to my constipation."
1521,395,1521,"No, I feel fine."
1522,396,1522,"Yes, and the Wellbutrin is an inhaler."
1523,396,1523,Yes.
1524,396,1524,Yes.
1525,397,1525,"Good afternoon, doctor."
1526,397,1526,"Oh, at this point I don't even know how long its been."
1527,397,1527,"Yes, we do."
1528,397,1528,I'm a school nurse for the School Department. I love working with the children.
1529,397,1529,"No, I don't drink, and I quit smoking cigarettes about twenty five years ago."
1530,399,1530,"Yes doctor, that's correct."
1531,399,1531,I use my right hand for everything.
1532,399,1532,I was doing well until July of nineteen ninety three.
1533,399,1533,"I began having weakness in my right arm, and there was some neck pain too."
1534,399,1534,"At first, I went to a chiropractor, but after a while my arm started atrophying, and my right hand felt tight. I couldn't extend all my fingers out."
1535,399,1535,"After that, I went to a neurosurgeon close to my house, and he ordered an, um, C T scan of my neck."
1536,399,1536,"Yes, doctor, I have it right here. They were one on the twenty fifth of September in ninety two."
1537,399,1537,"That means tumor, right?"
1538,399,1538,"Yeah, I have the op notes right here."
1539,399,1539,"Well, honestly, I improved for about three months following the operation, but after that I just got worse and worse."
1540,399,1540,"Um, I started having this burning sensation on my left side."
1541,399,1541,"Yeah, I had weakness in both my arms."
1542,399,1542,"Yes, my right side was worse than my left."
1543,399,1543,"Um, I had really bad balance, I felt nauseous, like I was going to throw up at all times, which I did do some, and, um, my heart was beating really fast, and my blood pressure went up really high."
1544,399,1544,"On, um, August thirty first nineteen ninety three I had an M R I of my neck, and I have that report right here, too."
1545,399,1545,"Sorry to interrupt, what does all that mean?"
1546,399,1546,"Yeah, I had brain surgery. I have those notes right here, too."
1547,399,1547,"That's cancer, right? This was all done on September first of nineteen ninety three."
1548,399,1548,"I felt good, the doctors said I stabilized out. I went through some radiation procedures from September of ninety three to January nineteenth of ninety four."
1549,399,1549,"I went to the NeuroOncology clinic on October twenty sixth nineteen ninety five because I was having weakness in both arms and both legs, as well as trouble swallowing food."
1550,399,1550,"It was so bad I couldn't even put on a shirt, or raise my arms, or even feed myself."
1551,399,1551,"No, not really, but I can climb them."
1552,399,1552,"Yeah, no problems there."
1553,399,1553,They were considering doing chemo.
1554,400,1554,Um no.
1555,401,1555,My left elbow. I hit it against a railing when I was trying to do a new trick on my skateboard.
1556,401,1556,"Yeah. I even tried icing it, but I think it's only gotten worse."
1557,401,1557,Only my elbow.
1558,401,1558,About a week ago.
1559,401,1559,No. I try to deal with the pain as best as I can before resorting to medicine.
1560,402,1560,"No, doc."
1561,402,1561,That I do.
1562,402,1562,I long time.
1563,402,1563,"Truly, I have no interest in doing that with my age."
1564,402,1564,Tell me something I don't know.
1565,402,1565,"I know you're not going to like hearing this, but I'm big on weed. I know, I know, I'm going to regret all of this at some point in time. It's just become a habit that's incredibly hard to break."
1566,402,1566,I go through a pack around every two weeks. Let's go with around twenty seven.
1567,403,1567,"No, I have not had any surgeries."
1568,403,1568,Yes.
1569,404,1569,Thank you.
1570,404,1570,Yes I was.
1571,404,1571,"Yes, I am."
1572,404,1572,Yes. I have a two year old son.
1573,404,1573,Yes. I had a miscarriage before my son was born.
1574,404,1574,Thank you.
1575,405,1575,Yes.
1576,405,1576,"Me, my spouse and three happy kids. One of them is ready to go to college."
1577,405,1577,Yes and no.
1578,405,1578,"I was an attorney but retired from my official post two years back. I just couldn't stay back home and do nothing, so I just joined a private company and am working there part time."
1579,405,1579,No.
1580,405,1580,Correct.
1581,406,1581,About thirty years back.
1582,406,1582,"No never. 
Guest_family: Mom, please let the doctor know about the time when you had it in the past."
1583,406,1583,"Okay. Yes, that."
1584,406,1584,I don't remember maybe more than twenty years.
1585,407,1585,"No, not that I can remember, and I have a good memory."
1586,407,1586,"No, I had all my children naturally."
1587,408,1587,No.
1588,408,1588,"No, not at all."
1589,408,1589,"Yeah, no fever or anything."
1590,408,1590,No.
1591,408,1591,No.
1592,408,1592,"I have this prolonged cough, but other than that nothing."
1593,408,1593,"No, no wheezing."
1594,408,1594,No.
1595,408,1595,No.
1596,408,1596,No.
1597,408,1597,No.
1598,408,1598,No.
1599,408,1599,No.
1600,408,1600,Nothing.
1601,408,1601,No.
1602,408,1602,No.
1603,408,1603,No.
1604,408,1604,No.
1605,408,1605,No.
1606,408,1606,It is fine.
1607,408,1607,It's good.
1608,408,1608,"No, nothing like that."
1609,408,1609,It's okay.
1610,408,1610,Sure.
1611,408,1611,No.
1612,408,1612,Nope.
1613,409,1613,No. I have never been a smoker.
1614,409,1614,"I have never been a drug user, but I used to drink a little, but it was never a problem. I don't drink any more."
1615,409,1615,I am retired. I used to be an insurance salesman.
1616,410,1616,Nope.
1617,411,1617,"Yes, doctor, that's correct."
1618,411,1618,"Well, I think I'm having some sexual dysfunction. I was wondering if Cialis would help."
1619,411,1619,"Well, I did a quiz online on the Cialis website and I didn't score in the normal range, so I figured I would come in."
1620,411,1620,"Well, there may be some decreased desire, but honestly, I don't think that's the main problem here. I'd like to have my erections last longer, doctor."
1621,411,1621,"Well, on the quiz, I said that less than half of the time I'm able to get an erection and keep an erection after penetration."
1622,411,1622,"Well, I'd say there's slight difficulty."
1623,411,1623,"No, not that I know of."
1624,411,1624,"No, that sounds painful, but no."
1625,411,1625,"No, not that I can remember."
1626,411,1626,"No, that doesn't sound familiar either."
1627,412,1627,Will you give me some medicine for my stomach pain? And what about that feeling to throw up all of the time?
1628,413,1628,Yes I was vomiting too.
1629,413,1629,It was all brown colored things like coffee.
1630,413,1630,Yes I am all better.
1631,413,1631,They told me I can go home.
1632,413,1632,I will do that.
1633,414,1633,"Well, I'd say it's been a lot worse this week. I haven't had much of an appetite either."
1634,414,1634,"I've lost about eight pounds, which is the most I've ever lost in a week's time."
1635,414,1635,No.
1636,414,1636,No.
1637,414,1637,No.
1638,415,1638,"Yes, indeed. At least for now. Who knows what the future will bring."
1639,416,1639,"Well, I'm sixty nine years old now, so I'm not as young as I used to be. But, these old knees have been bothering me for a couple years now."
1640,416,1640,"I hear clicking noises, which really bothers me when I'm going up stairs. There's also some stiffness when I try to move them."
1641,416,1641,"I absolutely used to be, and had no problems, but now this pain is affecting my daily life and activities."
1642,417,1642,"Nope, I never did any such thing."
1643,417,1643,Never.
1644,417,1644,"I'm retired. I used to work. I used to work in Morse chain. I also used to deliver newspapers. But now I'm retired, and I enjoy life."
1645,417,1645,I was happily married. But then my husband died.
1646,417,1646,I live alone. I do have family who lives very close by in the neighborhood. I have a niece who lives with her family in my house on Temple Street.
1647,418,1647,"Yes, actually, my mom told me that someone had cervical cancer."
1648,418,1648,"Yes, I know someone had heart disease, and another person had heart failure."
1649,418,1649,I know someone had C O P D.
1650,418,1650,"Yes, my uncle has dementia right now, actually."
1651,418,1651,"Thank you doctor, it's hard. Yes, my dad has the sugar."
1652,420,1652,My mom can give you the address. I still live with her.
1653,420,1653,Nope. My Mother has forbidden smoking in her home.
1654,421,1654,"Yes, I'm lucky to have, and live with my lovely wife."
1655,421,1655,"Yes, she was lovely as well, I hope you're paying them well."
1656,421,1656,"Thank you, Doctor."
1657,422,1657,Hi. I am doing fine.
1658,422,1658,I got hurt at work and now I am on disability.
1659,422,1659,I worked on the pipeline. The accident was five years ago.
1660,422,1660,I don't know really. I sent in all the notes for my doctor for evaluation and they approved the disability.
1661,422,1661,I live with my wife.
1662,422,1662,I used to smoke. I quit years ago.
1663,422,1663,"Oh, about twenty years ago."
1664,422,1664,Probably twenty years. I was up to two packs a day. I feel way better now.
1665,422,1665,Nope.
1666,422,1666,I don't really do much these days. Work was my hobby.
1667,423,1667,"Overall, pretty good."
1668,423,1668,"No, not really. Just dog sitting my friend's golden."
1669,423,1669,They are very sweet.
1670,423,1670,Yessir.
1671,423,1671,"Yeah, I go once every week or so."
1672,423,1672,"Manageable, I guess."
1673,423,1673,Not like it used to.
1674,424,1674,"No, none right now."
1675,425,1675,Yes. I smoke.
1676,425,1676,About a pack or two a day.
1677,425,1677,No. It is very rare that I will have a drink.
1678,425,1678,"Well, I don't know very much about my dad's side of the family but my dad did pass away from renal cancer."
1679,425,1679,Thank you.
1680,425,1680,No. They don't have any health problems. That I know of.
1681,426,1681,"Actually, I'm retired, I don't work at all anymore."
1682,426,1682,"Oh, I didn't go to college, I stopped after high school."
1683,426,1683,"Yes, my husband and I were blessed with three wonderful children."
1684,426,1684,"Nope, we got them all out of there. They're all grown now."
1685,426,1685,"No, I never had either."
1686,426,1686,"No, absolutely not."
1687,427,1687,Yes.
1688,427,1688,Okay.
1689,427,1689,Okay.
1690,428,1690,"Never smoked a cigarette a day in my life. As for alcohol, I'll drink socially with friends and family."
1691,431,1691,I am in foster care. My foster mom is going out of town on the nineteenth to the twenty third.
1692,431,1692,Can my mom and grandmother come and visit me here on Thursday? That is the day they usually come to visit me at my foster home.
1693,432,1693,"Yeah, almost everyone had diabetes."
1694,433,1694,No.
1695,434,1695,No.  My parents are healthy with no medical issues.
1696,434,1696,I have five kids.
1697,434,1697,My children are all healthy with no medical problems.
1698,435,1698,Nope.
1699,436,1699,I have no idea to be quite honest with you. My parents never shared their medical history with me and neither did their parents with them. I don't think they want any of us to worry.
1700,436,1700,Will do. Thanks for understanding.
1701,437,1701,I'm good. Thank you. How about you?
1702,437,1702,Twenty nine.
1703,437,1703,I'm from Vietnam.
1704,437,1704,"Yes, for my hand eczema."
1705,437,1705,"Yes, that's correct."
1706,437,1706,"Yes, I'm doing all that."
1707,437,1707,"I'm having this flaring. My hands are all dry. I have these like cracks in my hands. I have been washing with the soap and the lotions that you prescribed, but still, it is happening. Maybe because of cracks or what, I don't know, but the Cetaphil cleansing lotion, whenever I'm applying that it is causing me a lot of burning pain. I have been wearing gloves though."
1708,437,1708,"Still, a single. I'm not even looking for a husband yet."
1709,437,1709,Not currently.
1710,438,1710,"Um, I would say around four years now. Oh my God it has been so, so many medications that I had to take for this."
1711,438,1711,"No, I don't have any such conditions."
1712,438,1712,Nope.
1713,438,1713,No I have not.
1714,440,1714,Hello.
1715,440,1715,I am forty eight?
1716,440,1716,"No, I didn't get any periods for the last year after my surgery."
1717,440,1717,"Yes, it's been happening for the last several months. Sometimes I feel hot even in a fully air conditioned room. Other times I just feel like opening the refrigerator and standing in front of it."
1718,440,1718,I am also experiencing a lot of mood swings for the last few weeks.
1719,441,1719,"Um, no."
1720,441,1720,No.
1721,441,1721,"No, not really."
1722,441,1722,No.
1723,441,1723,No.
1724,441,1724,No.
1725,441,1725,"Um, no."
1726,442,1726,"Nope! I use to occasionally, very long time ago. But not anymore."
1727,442,1727,"No, none of those."
1728,442,1728,"Right, I don't do drugs either, never did. Even though pot is legal here, I never ever felt like trying."
1729,442,1729,Yeah.
1730,443,1730,No.
1731,443,1731,These medical terms I don't understand.
1732,443,1732,No.
1733,443,1733,Sure.
1734,443,1734,No.
1735,444,1735,"Great, I think. I just got a mammogram and nothing showed up. I still am taking my multivitamin and low dose aspirin."
1736,444,1736,"No changes. Check the chart, I answered that last time."
1737,444,1737,"No, I do not. I don't see a point if I come and do the mammogram."
1738,444,1738,"Yeah, I know. I am just lazy. Recently it has been hard to do a lot of my selfcare routines. I do not even exercise anymore."
1739,445,1739,I want to get surgery on my leg.
1740,445,1740,I did. Here's a list of them.
1741,445,1741,"Yeah. So, what options do I have for surgery?"
1742,446,1742,"I am good, he is my stepdad. 
Guest_family: Hi Doctor, how are you?"
1743,446,1743,"Dad I was fourteen, when it started."
1744,447,1744,None whatsoever.
1745,448,1745,Yeah.
1746,448,1746,"No, I had all of them and am up to date with my immunizations."
1747,449,1747,I have no complaints.
1748,449,1748,"Okay so my right hand and left foot was very swollen and very painful, and that's why I came to emergency room."
1749,449,1749,"Yes, I could not go so they put it in."
1750,449,1750,"I am feeling a little better, my pain is improving, and the swelling is getting better."
1751,449,1751,"No, no fever."
1752,449,1752,"No but I am not able to empty my bladder well, the pee has decreased a lot, I could not urinate."
1753,449,1753,No nothing like that.
1754,449,1754,"No pain, I can breathe well."
1755,450,1755,"No. As far as I know, no one else has it."
1756,451,1756,No.
1757,451,1757,No.
1758,451,1758,No.
1759,451,1759,"I feel great, my energy level is quite good."
1760,452,1760,"I am a diabetic, so I take Insulin."
1761,452,1761,It varies from day to day.
1762,453,1762,Just some pain in the buttock.
1763,453,1763,I do not have anything else.
1764,453,1764,Nope.
1765,454,1765,Yes. Sixty seven years young.
1766,454,1766,Right.
1767,454,1767,September first of nineteen ninety five.
1768,454,1768,"A local doctor I was seeing at the time. A year before my diagnosis, I had a few falls and episodes of lightheadedness. I also noticed that I was staggering a lot more when walking."
1769,454,1769,"Not that I know of. I had noticed that I was losing my normal voice to a degree. On top of losing my normal voice, my handwriting became smaller and smaller. I don't ever remember writing so small. Something seemed really off to me."
1770,454,1770,"It was very difficult. Two months prior to being diagnosed, I started to move much slower than before."
1771,454,1771,Yes. I was prescribed Sinemet back in September of nineteen ninety five.
1772,454,1772,None. I was pretty disappointed and discouraged as a result. I have problems with coordination and walking without staggering even today.
1773,454,1773,I felt weak in the morning and worse as the day went on.
1774,454,1774,No.
1775,454,1775,No.
1776,456,1776,"Yeah, mainly heart issues. My father died from heart attack."
1777,456,1777,She had the second type of diabetes.
1778,457,1778,"Yes, sir. None."
1779,458,1779,"No, I don't do any of that."
1780,458,1780,"No, none of that either."
1781,458,1781,"No, there's no history of any of that there."
1782,459,1782,I take Prilosec and Tramadol when I have back pain.
1783,460,1783,No.
1784,461,1784,At least three times until my stomach is empty.
1785,461,1785,Just when I eat raw carrots and celery.
1786,461,1786,Yes.
1787,462,1787,"Well, doctor, I'm sixty six years old now."
1788,462,1788,"It's so bad, doctor."
1789,462,1789,"No, they haven't helped at all."
1790,462,1790,What's the risk of infection from the surgery?
1791,462,1791,"Great, and will I be asleep for this?"
1792,463,1792,I am twenty four.
1793,463,1793,I have been having this back pain for a long time. I thought I should come and get it checked out because it has not gotten any better.
1794,464,1794,I don't know anything about that.
1795,464,1795,Nope.
1796,465,1796,I'm fifty five years old.
1797,465,1797,"I've been having a lot of problems recently, so I decided to come get it checked out by you."
1798,465,1798,"Oh, it's a long list. Here it is."
1799,465,1799,"Yeah, that sounds about right. I think I forgot to add it, but I also have bad allergies during the spring time."
1800,466,1800,Yes.
1801,466,1801,I have been in treatment for heroin and alcohol in the past.
1802,466,1802,I did do a little bit of coke today.
1803,467,1803,Meds?
1804,467,1804,I do. I take Allegra for seasonal allergies. I also take something that starts with a P. I'm blanking on the name. My other doctor prescribed it to me for exercise induced asthma.
1805,467,1805,"Yes, that's it! I keep that on hand in case my asthma gets outta control."
1806,467,1806,"You mean is it expired? No, I don't think so. It hasn't been long since I visited the pharmacy."
1807,468,1807,Thank you.
1808,468,1808,That is going to be a hard one. I was adopted and I do not know any family medical history.
1809,469,1809,That's right.
1810,469,1810,Sure.
1811,469,1811,That's right. I was then scheduled for the overnight sleep study to be evaluated for interruptions in my sleep and here we are today to discuss results.
1812,469,1812,It is consistent. I go to bed anytime between nine to ten at night and wake up in the morning around five to six.
1813,469,1813,"No, it's hard for me to start that sleeping process and then I'm awake in like every one or two hours throughout the night. I keep on tossing and turning throughout the night. I always find my sheets out of order when I wake up."
1814,469,1814,I would say I slept better in the laboratory than I do at home.
1815,469,1815,"Honestly, I feel tired. Sometimes I also have this dull headache."
1816,469,1816,"I don't know for myself, but yeah, my daughter was teasing me another day that I was snoring and was talking in my sleep."
1817,469,1817,No. But I used to cough a lot in the middle of the night.
1818,469,1818,"Yeah, I haven't been coughing for the last few weeks."
1819,469,1819,"I spent a lot of time reading and watching T V. Sometimes I doze off while doing that. Not regular, but I do take nap sometimes in between two to three in afternoon and also in the evening hours."
1820,469,1820,"Oh yes, I take around one to two packs of cigarettes each day mainly after dinner."
1821,469,1821,My weight always keeps fluctuating. I remember I was at my maximum weight of two hundred and sixty pounds around one year ago.
1822,469,1822,Now it is down by approximately thirty pounds.
1823,469,1823,"Yes, that's right."
1824,469,1824,That sounds right.
1825,470,1825,Yes.
1826,470,1826,"Yes, both."
1827,470,1827,"Yes, mini stroke!"
1828,470,1828,Okay.
1829,470,1829,"Just Coumadin, for my chronic A Fib. I have been on it three years."
1830,470,1830,Yes.
1831,471,1831,"Good morning, doctor."
1832,471,1832,"Honestly, I'm feeling a little bit better."
1833,473,1833,Thank you.
1834,473,1834,No. I was born and raised in North Carolina. I am the sixth of nine siblings.
1835,473,1835,"My family has significant amount of diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, thyroid problems, autoimmune disease, possible multiple sclerosis, and depression issues."
1836,473,1836,My dad died due to complications of his diabetes.  He passed when he was sixty. My dad was a chef. My mom is doing well. She is ninety three. Both my parents never finished high school. My dad had a third grade education and my mom made it through fourth grade. She was a janitor. She was a smart woman she just never finished her schooling. My parents encouraged me to finish school and to go to college. I got my Bachelor of Science in Nursing at the State University in nineteen seventy nine.
1837,473,1837,"No. I mostly got A's and B's.  My strongest subject was math, but my worst subject was spelling. My grades were still quite good in spelling, but I had to work hard at it."
1838,473,1838,"I was married for two years. We had two children together. They are forty three and thirty now. My son is the youngest, lives nearby and calls me or stops by every day. My daughter calls me often but she lives in New York. We are close. Their dad, my exhusband passed away in nineteen eighty. He was an alcoholic. His pancreas had enough and shut down."
1839,473,1839,He did it to himself.
1840,473,1840,"I worked for Hospital Center for four years. Prior to that, I worked for an outpatient mental health center. I was there for about two and a years. I was fired or laid off I guess? I was not sure why they let me go. I was given no explanation. And before that, I worked for Walter P. Carter Center for twenty one years. I also worked as an O B nurse.  Other than the two instances, I had never been fired or let go from a job."
1841,473,1841,"I enjoy reading, doing puzzles, playing computer games. I joined a women's support group for women my age. I keep myself, busy."
1842,474,1842,"Good afternoon, doctor."
1843,474,1843,I'm thirteen.
1844,475,1844,"Good afternoon, doctor."
1845,475,1845,Sure.
1846,475,1846,"No, not that I know of."
1847,475,1847,"No, I'm not."
1848,475,1848,"Okay, that's fine, doctor."
1849,475,1849,"Yes, I've taken everything exactly as you told me to."
1850,475,1850,"Yeah, it was in November of two thousand seven."
1851,475,1851,They pulled two teeth for me.
1852,475,1852,It was about a year ago.
1853,475,1853,"Yes, thankfully."
1854,475,1854,"No, not yet. I'm not old enough."
1855,475,1855,"No, I don't, at least not that I know of."
1856,476,1856,"No, I am not comfortable with that. I don't want you to do that."
1857,477,1857,I fell four times on third of this month because my leg suddenly gave out.
1858,477,1858,You don't ask age of a lady. She will never tell you the truth.
1859,477,1859,That's true. I'm just teasing you. I'm fifty one.
1860,477,1860,I am right handed.
1861,477,1861,"Oh, I noticed weakness in my right leg before as well and sometimes, like, I have to give the support of my arm to actually move it. Sometimes during these episodes I just turn pale and it's like overall weakness. I feel so tired. My husband, he gives me some sugar, three teaspoons, and then it helps a little bit but not completely."
1862,477,1862,"It's overall. I remember in one of these episodes I was, like, in an odd fisted posture."
1863,477,1863,"No, nothing like that."
1864,477,1864,Nope.
1865,477,1865,Nope.
1866,477,1866,No.
1867,477,1867,"Nope. It's just that I fall and then fell again last night. I was feeling so weak. Nothing was helping me. That's when, in the morning, my husband brought me to the U I H C hospital for the evaluation on the fifth."
1868,478,1868,Oh yeah. Diabetes and high blood pressure runs in my family.
1869,478,1869,"Yeah, my mom suffered with a stroke when she was in her seventies."
1870,479,1870,"No, I'm divorced."
1871,479,1871,"Yes, so I have no support at home, it's difficult."
1872,479,1872,"No, I never have."
1873,479,1873,"No, absolutely not."
1874,480,1874,We have some heart issues in my family. My sister died during heart surgery two years ago.
1875,480,1875,Thank you. My mom died of a heart attack.
1876,480,1876,She was in her seventies? My dad died from a brain hemorrhage. He was only forty nine.
1877,480,1877,"Yes, we have."
1878,480,1878,I have another sister. Oh yeah. She is a diabetic.
1879,480,1879,"Yes, I have daughter. The only health problem she has is high cholesterol."
1880,480,1880,No. I don't think so.
1881,481,1881,Not that I know.
1882,481,1882,Nope.
1883,482,1883,"Yes, I am."
1884,482,1884,"You see, I am a missionary. I have four kids. My eldest is seven years old. Then the other ones are five and three and this one is the youngest. She is just six weeks old."
1885,483,1885,"I'm thirty nine, doctor."
1886,483,1886,I've had this bunion for a good few months now.
1887,483,1887,"Absolutely, I can't take it anymore."
1888,483,1888,"I got some wider shoes, and it's done absolutely nothing."
1889,483,1889,Is there surgery or something we can do? I can't take the pain.
1890,484,1890,I'm twenty eight.
1891,484,1891,"No, this is my second pregnancy. I had gestational diabetes with my first one as well."
1892,484,1892,"Yes, I used insulin last time as well. I'm just here to understand if diet can help me with my gestational diabetes."
1893,484,1893,"My Gynecologist was saying something about ketones, I don't know what they are. She asked me to talk about them with you."
1894,484,1894,Thank you.
1895,484,1895,I walk everyday with my daughter. I go to drop her to school and then back home.
1896,484,1896,"It takes around twenty minutes on one side. So, everyday it is like forty minutes in the morning and same in the evening around four."
1897,484,1897,"I try to, I know it is a good source of calcium and is very essential especially with my pregnancy, but I am not a big fan of drinking milk."
1898,485,1898,"I'm sorry, what's that?"
1899,485,1899,"Actually, yeah, my great grandmother had that, and my mom would talk about my second cousin, he had it too."
1900,486,1900,About eleven years ago. It's definitely been nice. I'm able to spend more time with my grandkids.
1901,486,1901,I have four grandkids between the ages of two and eleven. I live in the county with my wife and dog. My wife and I've been together for thirty some years now.
1902,487,1902,"Good afternoon, doctor."
1903,487,1903,"Well, since the last visit I've gained about a pound."
1904,487,1904,"Yeah, I've been working really hard, but I haven't been able to get the weight down any further so far."
1905,487,1905,"My lowest? That was one hundred thirty six. I'm just as frustrated as you are, doctor."
1906,487,1906,Why is that?
1907,487,1907,"Okay, yes, I agree."
1908,488,1908,"No, no one had a stroke in my family."
1909,488,1909,No one that I can remember.
1910,489,1910,"You know doctor, I was born in Munich, Germany."
1911,489,1911,"Yeah, I always knew how to speak English even before I was a teen. So, when I moved to America I did not have any language problem."
1912,489,1912,"No, my family moved to the eastern side of the Germany which was occupied by Russia at that time, but I decided to move to America in nineteen fifty seven."
1913,489,1913,"I had a high school degree from Germany, and I could speak German and English fluently."
1914,489,1914,"As soon as I landed here in America, I started working. I started as a secretary at a private firm and later did clerical work at I B M. Now I am retired for almost twenty years due to my cancer complications."
1915,489,1915,Yeah.
1916,489,1916,"Well currently I am alone without any companion. I am divorced. I have a son who lives in Santa Cruz he has grand children, but I have not seen them, I am trying to get in touch with them. I want to see my grandkids."
1917,489,1917,Other than him I have a brother and a sister both are healthy and living their life we don't talk much.
1918,489,1918,"Hm, nothing significant."
1919,489,1919,No.
1920,490,1920,Yeah. I am forty five. I've had really bad stomach pain on my right side since last week.
1921,490,1921,I'd have to say a seven.
1922,490,1922,Oh um it's at a five at the moment.
1923,490,1923,Micronase?
1924,490,1924,"Yeah, I've been taking it every day."
1925,491,1925,"No, unfortunately. I suffer from a few medical problems so maybe that's to blame."
1926,491,1926,Right.
1927,491,1927,"In the family? No, but heart disease does."
1928,492,1928,Not bad. Although I hafta admit it was difficult staying up in preparation for it.
1929,492,1929,I am forty eight.
1930,493,1930,Ugh.
1931,493,1931,You got that right. I've had a fever on and off for the past few days.
1932,493,1932,Right before I drove here.
1933,493,1933,"Yes, she did."
1934,493,1934,Um no not really.
1935,493,1935,Yeah. I've taken Tylenol and that's helped a bit.
1936,493,1936,I don't think so. I live with three other roommates and they seem fine.
1937,494,1937,No. What do you mean?
1938,494,1938,No everything is well. No other problems.
1939,495,1939,"It was okay. I was nervous to go under the knife at first, but it turned out better than I expected. Do you know others who've gotten hysterectomies that are near my age?"
1940,495,1940,Me too.
1941,496,1941,I have these rashes on my arms.
1942,496,1942,"Yeah, I do. I gave it to the nurse."
1943,496,1943,"Oh, yeah. We all usually get some type of rash."
1944,496,1944,Uh. What's that's?
1945,496,1945,Uhm. I don't think so.
1946,496,1946,Not that I know of.
1947,497,1947,"Well, I will call myself a social drinker. I would admit that I am addicted to caffeine."
1948,497,1948,I would say three to five cups.
1949,497,1949,Nope.
1950,497,1950,I would say I am a good eater and follow a healthy diet plan.
1951,497,1951,"I walk every day around five miles. Also, I'm very regular in my sprint training."
1952,498,1952,"Yes, I passed out and the paramedics brought me to the hospital."
1953,498,1953,I think I had a seizure and then I passed out.
1954,498,1954,No.
1955,498,1955,No.
1956,498,1956,No.
1957,498,1957,I feel fine.
1958,498,1958,I am sixty nine.
1959,499,1959,"I am okay, my arms are troubling me so much."
1960,499,1960,"Yeah, and hands too"
1961,499,1961,"Yeah, it's right here in the middle part of arm and my palm."
1962,499,1962,"No, but I do feel this tingling sensation kind of like numbness in my left hand, and it gets worse at night after doing repetitive work."
1963,499,1963,"No, I'm right handed"
1964,499,1964,"Not really, nothing substantial."
1965,499,1965,I am fifty two.
1966,499,1966,Nope!
1967,499,1967,"Ah yes, I am taking Lyrica."
1968,499,1968,"Yes, somewhat."
1969,499,1969,No.
1970,499,1970,"Yes, no changes."
1971,499,1971,"No, it's all fine."
1972,499,1972,And?
1973,499,1973,What does that means?
1974,499,1974,"Oh, how did that happen?"
1975,499,1975,"Oh, that explains my increased pain in the night after work."
1976,499,1976,Anything else came in the neuro test?
1977,499,1977,Okay. I am worried now.
1978,499,1978,Thank you!
1979,500,1979,"No, do you have those results with you right now?"
1980,500,1980,"That makes sense, thank you for sharing that with me."
1981,501,1981,It's mostly on the left side.
1982,501,1982,Um a few days ago.
1983,501,1983,Kinda dull.
1984,501,1984,"Not really, no."
1985,501,1985,For a few minutes. It comes and goes.
1986,501,1986,"I've taken some Advil, but it doesn't seem to help."
1987,501,1987,"No, I don't think so."
1988,501,1988,Yes. Do you think the pain is related?
1989,503,1989,"No, I do not smoke or drink alcohol."
1990,503,1990,"Nope, I have never."
1991,503,1991,Just my family.
1992,504,1992,I am sixty five. My kids just through me a surprise birthday party last week.
1993,504,1993,It was nice.
1994,504,1994,Yeah.
1995,504,1995,Yes.
1996,504,1996,He has me coming in about every three or four months.
1997,504,1997,Has it been that long?
1998,504,1998,"Sadly, yes."
1999,504,1999,I noticed the change when I started taking the Proscar.
2000,504,2000,I take Viagra sometimes.
2001,504,2001,There is some improvement.
2002,504,2002,I still get up about three to four times.
2003,504,2003,"Yes, but I have not had any U T Is since I have been on the Proscar."
2004,505,2004,"Yes, I am,"
2005,505,2005,"Well, no. I've been married three times now."
2006,505,2006,"I don't mind at all, my longest was two years."
2007,505,2007,"Yes, I have two."
2008,505,2008,"They're both fifteen, they're twins, obviously. They're my wife's dependents, though."
2009,505,2009,"Yeah, I have my bachelor's. I got the military to pay for it."
2010,505,2010,"I did six years, sir. I was honorably discharged."
2011,505,2011,"I've worked at Purdy Correctional Institute, you know, the one in Gig Harbor? I've worked there for nineteen years."
2012,506,2012,C B D?
2013,506,2013,Oh!
2014,506,2014,"Oh, I see."
2015,509,2015,No.
2016,509,2016,No.
2017,509,2017,No.
2018,510,2018,"No, I don't have family!"
2019,510,2019,My mom dad died and I was raised in the Philippines.
2020,510,2020,No by myself.
2021,510,2021,Oh it's a story for another day.
2022,511,2022,"No, not that I can think of."
2023,511,2023,"Yes, I have. I've broken my hand and tibia before."
2024,512,2024,Thank you.
2025,512,2025,No. None that I know of.
2026,513,2026,I have had appendix surgery when I was twenty one years old and eight years back I had C Section.
2027,513,2027,"Sure, I have only two."
2028,513,2028,"Yes, I get heavy periods because of fibroids in my uterus."
2029,513,2029,"Oh, you can say about three weeks back."
2030,514,2030,"I'm forty nine years old, and I identify as white."
2031,514,2031,I was referred to you so that I could get whatever's wrong with me under control.
2032,514,2032,I hurt the back of my leg pretty bad this past year when I was in A B C D.
2033,514,2033,The back of my left thigh.
2034,514,2034,I also hurt my kneecap from a boat when I was out in the water fishing.
2035,514,2035,"It was a whole show. A helicopter came down and swooped me to X Y Z Hospital, where I got surgery."
2036,514,2036,"Yeah, they did. Here you go."
2037,514,2037,Yeah. Whatever that means.
2038,514,2038,Go for it.
2039,514,2039,Is that bad?
2040,514,2040,"No, I'm not."
2041,515,2041,"Ah yes, I am a painter."
2042,515,2042,"Yes, I do."
2043,515,2043,"Well, about two packs a day."
2044,515,2044,"No sir, I don't drink."
2045,515,2045,You mean like cocaine and stuff?
2046,515,2046,"No, no drugs."
2047,516,2047,Thank you. It is nice to meet you.
2048,516,2048,Yes. He is my primary care doctor.
2049,516,2049,"Thank you. Yes, I am going to be seventy seven."
2050,516,2050,"Yes. The pain started four or five days ago. It has been in my stomach and through to my back, on the left side. Right here."
2051,516,2051,"Yes. I had some nausea, and I threw up a few times."
2052,516,2052,No.
2053,516,2053,No.
2054,516,2054,Is there some thing we can do to remove it? I really want this taken care of.
2055,517,2055,"Good afternoon, doctor. Yes, that's correct."
2056,517,2056,Why would I do that?
2057,517,2057,"Oh, no, I haven't yet."
2058,517,2058,"I heard it once, but I can't remember anything. Can you remind me?"
2059,517,2059,"Oh, that's a lot, doctor."
2060,517,2060,"Well, I've felt good for the last two days."
2061,517,2061,"Yeah, I can actually move all four."
2062,517,2062,"No, nothing of note there."
2063,517,2063,"Yeah, doctor, I'm not going back to the O R."
2064,517,2064,"Okay doctor, I'd like to do it here."
2065,517,2065,Can you tell me the details about what you're going to do?
2066,517,2066,Are you going to use anesthesia?
2067,519,2067,Thank you.
2068,519,2068,Okay.
2069,519,2069,"Well, right now I am living with my sister in Sacaton. I am currently looking for my own place, but I am staying with her for now."
2070,519,2070,No. I will probably look for a place back in Coolidge.
2071,519,2071,"I recently separated from my wife. We lived in Coolidge together. Sacaton is too far away from everything, but it is fine for now."
2072,519,2072,Thank you. My sister has been a saint. I am not working right now so my sister is letting me stay with her for free. She gave up her home office and made me a nice room to stay in.
2073,519,2073,"Not when we were growing up but now that we are older, we have become very close. She has been a great support for me in these hard times."
2074,519,2074,I smoke cigarettes. I only smoke a little bit.
2075,519,2075,I only smoke about one or two cigarettes a day.
2076,519,2076,I have never used drugs. I used to be a heavy drinker. I quit drinking a year ago.
2077,519,2077,"No, but I might start. Things have been very stressful lately with the separation and being on unemployment."
2078,519,2078,Okay.
2079,519,2079,Great. Thank you.
2080,520,2080,I am feeling much better. My sugar levels are normal.
2081,520,2081,What was my blood sugar during surgery?
2082,520,2082,I am getting a special insulin?
2083,520,2083,Can I go home?
2084,521,2084,"Good morning, doctor."
2085,521,2085,"Yes, that's all correct."
2086,521,2086,"Well, I'm having some pain in this foot, it's right over this bone."
2087,521,2087,"Yes, it really hurts right there."
2088,521,2088,Usually wearing shoes makes it worse.
2089,521,2089,"Well, I have a history of multiple osteochondromas."
2090,521,2090,"No, no one ever figured it out, they just said it was hereditary."
2091,521,2091,"Yeah, I had a surgery for this a while ago."
2092,521,2092,"No, this is new. Can we do that surgery again? I can't take this pain."
2093,522,2093,Okay.
2094,522,2094,Sure.
2095,523,2095,"Yeah, I guess. I've tried to also reduce my salt intake to about two grams."
2096,524,2096,"Yeah, that's fine."
2097,524,2097,"Yeah, we do. We have a strong history of heart disease. I think it could be because we drink a lot."
2098,524,2098,"Oh, yeah. We drink a lot every day. Beer, liquor, you name it."
2099,525,2099,"No, sir. I've been retired for a couple years now."
2100,525,2100,You bet.
2101,525,2101,"Uh I quit about twenty seven years ago. If I had to guess, I smoked about two packs a day."
2102,525,2102,"Cigars, too."
2103,525,2103,Hardly ever.
2104,526,2104,"Thank you, doctor. I hope you can fix me up quickly."
2105,526,2105,I'm forty seven years old.
2106,526,2106,"I identify as white, sir."
2107,526,2107,"Well, I have this, um, mass of my left foot, it's been getting worse too."
2108,526,2108,"It's been about two weeks now, but it's getting worse way faster now."
2109,526,2109,"No, but I've had an, um, shave biopsy in the past."
2110,526,2110,Is there any surgery we can do for this to cut it off? I really want it gone.
2111,527,2111,"Actually, I'm retired now, but I was an engineer, and I did some real estate brokering as well on the side."
2112,527,2112,"Thank you, now I get to spend more time with my wife."
2113,527,2113,"Yes, five in total, it's a full house."
2114,527,2114,"I don't smoke, but I drink a little."
2115,527,2115,"Um, I'd say up to three drinks a week."
2116,527,2116,"No, never anything like that."
2117,528,2117,"Yes, I have diabetes, hypertension and gallstones."
2118,528,2118,What are the new things?
2119,529,2119,Nope. I quit like fifteen years ago.
2120,530,2120,"What, like arthritis?"
2121,530,2121,"No, not that I know of."
2122,531,2122,"Hi! Thank you.
Guest_clinician: I'm going to get a little background information from you today."
2123,531,2123,"Okay. 
Guest_clinician: What are any of your medical history conditions? Past and present?"
2124,531,2124,"I have Crohn's disease.
Guest_clinician: How long have you had Crohn's?"
2125,531,2125,"Oh, I don't know. A long time twenty five to thirty years.
Guest_clinician: Have you had a colonoscopy recently?"
2126,531,2126,"I had one, four years ago. Do I need to get another one this year?
Guest_clinician: I am not sure. I will ask the doctor what his recommendation is for you would be. I will let him know that you had a colonoscopy four years ago."
2127,531,2127,"Sounds good. I am also a diabetic. That has been going on for four years now.
Guest_clinician: Yes, I see you take insulin. I also see that you're on a blood pressure medication, do you have high blood pressure?"
2128,531,2128,"Yes, I have high blood pressure and high cholesterol. I also have heart disease. I had a stent placed in there.
Guest_clinician: Anything else?"
2129,531,2129,"I have arthritis now. They said it's due to my Crohn's.
Guest_clinician: That makes sense."
2130,531,2130,"I'm being treated for depression now as well.
Guest_clinician: Okay. Any other surgeries other than the stent?"
2131,531,2131,"Oh, I had a kidney stone removed several years ago. Twenty five years ago. That's it. That's all I got for you.
Guest_clinician: Okay, great! Thank you. I will go let the doctor know that you are ready and she will be right in to see you."
2132,531,2132,I'll be here.
2133,532,2133,"No, it is normal."
2134,532,2134,"No, everything is fine."
2135,532,2135,No cholesterol problem.
2136,535,2136,"Yes, I have been having dizzy spells. I have also noticed a new rash on my right calf."
2137,535,2137,It is general dizziness and vertigo. I am also lightheaded during the spells.
2138,535,2138,"I am having headaches off and on randomly, but nothing right now. The neck pain and muscle aches also are intermittent."
2139,535,2139,"They are new, I think. I have noticed them more than usual."
2140,535,2140,"No, nothing like that."
2141,535,2141,"I have had some tightness in my chest, but not right now."
2142,535,2142,"Yes, but I have not had to throw up or anything."
2143,535,2143,"No, thank goodness."
2144,535,2144,"I do have some left shoulder pain. Not so much painful, but it is uncomfortable and tender."
2145,535,2145,I measured it today. After lunch it was one fifty five.
2146,536,2146,No.
2147,536,2147,"Yes, my father died of a cancer called mesothelioma and my mother died of Hodgkin's Lymphoma."
2148,537,2148,Nope.
2149,537,2149,Nope.
2150,538,2150,I am feeling very tired.
2151,538,2151,No. I have been seeing Doctor Lin.
2152,538,2152,Last month I lost my job. And then this month my boyfriend left me.
2153,538,2153,"Yeah, it has been hard."
2154,538,2154,Doctor Lin just said that I was depressed.
2155,538,2155,I have taken Lexapro before.
2156,538,2156,I can't remember.
2157,539,2157,No. None that I know of.
2158,541,2158,Not too bad. I'm hanging in there. My asthma has been acting up.
2159,541,2159,For the past three months. I've been using my inhaler every day. I used to use it every now and again. This is definitely new for me.
2160,541,2160,"Yes, actually. My husband has been hauling a lot more corn this season and it seems to be making my allergies much worse."
2161,541,2161,"Not really. I'll sometimes take Allegra and that seems to help just a tiny bit. I was previously prescribed Flonase, but I can't remember the last time I took it. Oh and I was on Advair, too."
2162,541,2162,I had to stop Advair because it started to bother my lady parts.
2163,541,2163,I noticed that it became more itchy as a result.
2164,541,2164,"Speaking of this, I wanted to also share that I've been experiencing a lot of P M S symptoms lately. I'm super impatient and moody."
2165,541,2165,Um lemme think. The symptoms start about a week before my period and tend to get less intense once I get over the first day of bleeding.
2166,541,2166,"For the most part, yes. I feel like they don't last as long as they used to. I'm not sure why. I do, however, notice some spotting after my cycles end."
2167,541,2167,No.
2168,541,2168,I did have a U T I and some blood in my urine because of it.
2169,541,2169,Hm about three times. I was prescribed antibiotics for it.
2170,541,2170,Nothing now.
2171,541,2171,"No, not yet. I really should get it checked out again."
2172,541,2172,"Yeah, I can call to make the appointment tomorrow. Do I also need to get blood work done?"
2173,541,2173,"I had blood work done a few days ago for my life insurance application. I am forty two so thought I should get that going. My Swedish mother always used to nag about how I procrastinate on important things. Anyways, do I still need to get more blood work done?"
2174,541,2174,I think the typical blood work with cholesterol added.
2175,541,2175,I can fax them to you once I get them back.
2176,542,2176,I have this acne. I hate it. I am not feeling comfortable in my own skin.
2177,544,2177,Yes my father. They did his heart bypass surgery when he was sixty.
2178,544,2178,Yes I know what you mean.
2179,544,2179,"Yes by God's grace, both my parents are alive."
2180,544,2180,Yeah they said it was something called coronary artery disease and he had many strokes due to that.
2181,544,2181,My father is in his eighties. My mother is eighty years old too and she has dementia. My father has dementia too.
2182,544,2182,No I do not drink or smoke.
2183,545,2183,No.
2184,545,2184,No.
2185,548,2185,Yes.
2186,549,2186,"Yes, yes, many, many problems. Firstly, they pulled out so many teeth and now I have this bad tooth problem."
2187,549,2187,"Yes, it's a new pain. Right now it has been going on for three days on left side's upper and lower teeth."
2188,549,2188,I would have but I have missed so many appointments that they now do not allow me to schedule regular appointments. So they put me on a standby appointment now.
2189,549,2189,It is okay.
2190,549,2190,No.
2191,549,2191,"No, no illness whatsoever."
2192,549,2192,Yes I have  OxyContin and Vicodin at home. I use it for my knee pain. But I want more pain medicines. I do not want to use up that medicine for my toothache.
2193,549,2193,I am twenty nine.
2194,550,2194,The pain seems to have gotten worse.
2195,550,2195,"Sure. Ow, ow, ow. That's the spot that hurts the most. What's causing it?"
2196,551,2196,"Yes, I take it once a day."
2197,551,2197,It is ten M G tablet.
2198,551,2198,Yes.
2199,551,2199,Just Tramadol as needed.
2200,552,2200,My mom and dad are both diabetics. My mom has high blood pressure. My brother is having some issues with his liver.
2201,553,2201,I have or had two sons both born normally without any complications.
2202,553,2202,"One of my sons was a heavy smoker, he uses to smoke a whole packet or more in a day. We tried everything possible, but he just couldn't quit. He died of clots."
2203,553,2203,"Yes, my father had heart related issues, he died in his sixties, my mother died of colon cancer. I also have a sister but I don't think she has any issues."
2204,554,2204,Yes.
2205,554,2205,"No, I don't consume alcohol."
2206,554,2206,No.
2207,555,2207,No divorced. I live a lone.
2208,555,2208,I am a retired postal worker.
2209,555,2209,"Yes, I have three of my own and seven grandkids."
2210,555,2210,Yes I do.
2211,555,2211,"I keep changing the brands but Newport, one pack a day."
2212,555,2212,No drugs but I drink occasionally depending on the company.
2213,555,2213,Thirty years now.
2214,556,2214,Hello Doctor! I am good.
2215,556,2215,"I am here today for my follow-up, as suggested."
2216,556,2216,"Yes, seeing you after a month."
2217,557,2217,I am allergic to IV contrast.
2218,557,2218,Yes.
2219,558,2219,Oh can that be related to each other?
2220,558,2220,What else?
2221,558,2221,I am asking anything else?
2222,559,2222,Very itchy. I just keep scratching myself.
2223,559,2223,"Yeah, it's all over my back and stomach."
2224,559,2224,"I woke up this morning and started itching my back. After a few minutes, I noticed the rash was on my arms, chest, back, and stomach areas."
2225,559,2225,Sounds good.
2226,559,2226,Ah.
2227,559,2227,That's good to hear.
2228,559,2228,Not that I know of.
2229,559,2229,"Uh. A few days ago, I was working and had to remove some insulation. Other than that, I don't know what else could have given me these rashes."
2230,559,2230,"Nope I was not itchy. Also, my diet has been the same."
2231,559,2231,I haven't.
2232,559,2232,Not that I know of.
2233,560,2233,"I know that my brother has them too. Mom, do you know if anyone else gets them? 
Guest_family: Your grandfather had migraines."
2234,561,2234,I am retired now. I was a school teacher.
2235,561,2235,Yes.
2236,561,2236,I would say about a half to a full pack a day.
2237,561,2237,Probably sixty years.
2238,562,2238,"No, I am not."
2239,562,2239,Nope nothing.
2240,563,2240,I feel out of it.
2241,563,2241,I did a little heroin and some coke earlier today. I still feel high.
2242,563,2242,No.
2243,563,2243,No.
2244,563,2244,No.
2245,564,2245,"Yes, in fact I had a hysterectomy back in March of ninety nine. I believe it was done on the twentieth of the month."
2246,565,2246,"You know Doctor, I am widowed for eighteen years now. Never remarried, I live by myself in my house."
2247,565,2247,"No, I use to run a restaurant, but now retired."
2248,565,2248,"No, I don't!  Never liked the smell."
2249,565,2249,"No, I don't drink either."
2250,566,2250,I'm sixty five years old.
2251,566,2251,I'm right handed.
2252,566,2252,"Well, it was on January seventeenth. I had these episodes where I was like always so confused and looks like I lost everything. All my memory and everything. And then they did a scan. It was verified that I was having a stroke on the same day."
2253,566,2253,They gave me an anticonvulsant and aspirin.
2254,566,2254,"There have a few times like one or two days that I forgot to take my, uh, dyphenhydramine, but even when I'm taking it regularly, I'm still having all those symptoms or forgetfulness, confusion, and everything."
2255,566,2255,"No nothing else, just the confusion and forgetfulness."
2256,566,2256,"Well, they occur like two or three times in a week. Each one of the episodes lasts for like one or two minutes."
2257,567,2257,"Yeah, my father had a special kind of tumor, which doctors said is very rare."
2258,567,2258,"I don't remember the exact name of the disease, but it was a big name and it started with something with V."
2259,568,2259,"Actually, I have a whole list of conditions. I have them written down here."
2260,568,2260,"Yes, I told you I have a lot going on."
2261,568,2261,"Well, they wanted me to take Coumadin but I had, um, a subdural hematoma so they would let me."
2262,568,2262,"Well, I have depression, and I've had panic attacks while taking Doxepin before."
2263,568,2263,"Yes, another doctor told me about that."
2264,568,2264,"Um, I'm having some difficulty swallowing."
2265,569,2265,Okay.
2266,569,2266,Sure.
2267,570,2267,Yes I do.
2268,570,2268,Yes.
2269,570,2269,That sounds right.
2270,570,2270,Yeah.
2271,571,2271,"No, none."
2272,572,2272,"I live right around here, I'm a local girl."
2273,572,2273,"Yes, doctor, I work full time."
2274,572,2274,"No, absolutely not, doctor."
2275,573,2275,"I am okay, I have got this ulcer on my right hip again."
2276,573,2276,Pretty much.
2277,573,2277,Yeah. They keep saying I have some hidden split in my spine still.
2278,573,2278,I am just so frustrated sitting in my wheelchair. I am spending around sixteen hours a day in this wheelchair.
2279,573,2279,"Yeah, I recently celebrated my thirtieth birthday just sitting in my wheelchair the whole day."
2280,573,2280,"It's been several weeks, so I thought I should get it checked."
2281,573,2281,No.
2282,573,2282,No.
2283,574,2283,"Nope, nothing like that."
2284,574,2284,"No, there's no sugar here that I know of."
2285,574,2285,"Absolutely, they're in great shape. There's nothing like that here."
2286,575,2286,Nope.
2287,576,2287,When should I start to feel better?
2288,577,2288,No.
2289,577,2289,No.
2290,577,2290,"Um, no."
2291,577,2291,"No, nothing like that."
2292,577,2292,"No, no such history."
2293,578,2293,"My dad has high blood pressure, and he takes medication for it. He is now eighty two years old. He had a stroke around two years ago. This was his second stroke. First one he had when he was forty five."
2294,578,2294,My mom is eighty years old. She does have sugar issues.
2295,579,2295,"Yep. Just me, myself, and I."
2296,579,2296,I've been working as a plumber for the last five years.
2297,579,2297,Mostly in the city.
2298,579,2298,"I drink and smoke here and there, but I've never tried hard drugs."
2299,579,2299,I was in Mexico earlier this year.
2300,579,2300,Relaxing. Much needed.
2301,579,2301,"I'm sexually active with women, but my sex life isn't as good as it was in Japan. Over there, I would mix and mingle with prostitutes."
2302,579,2302,I don't really remember.
2303,579,2303,Yep. I'm negative for right now.
2304,579,2304,Nope.
2305,579,2305,"No, thank God."
2306,580,2306,"Good afternoon, Doctor, I have a lot of lower back pain."
2307,580,2307,I'm seventy five now. Right.
2308,580,2308,It's been about ten days now.
2309,580,2309,"No, they keep getting worse."
2310,580,2310,"Yes, it started radiating down my right leg three days after the lower back pain began, and then the left leg three days after the right. The next day I could barely walk, the pain was so severe."
2311,580,2311,"Um, it was on December third nineteen ninety five."
2312,580,2312,"Yes, I saw my local physician, um, it was on December eleventh, but he wasn't able to pinpoint what was going on."
2313,580,2313,He gave me some antiinflammatories and sent me on my way.
2314,580,2314,"Yes, I did."
2315,580,2315,"Um, by the time I got home, I could hardly walk due to the back pain, and I had weakness in my legs. I was, however, able to feed my dogs, and I fixed myself some dinner."
2316,580,2316,Yes. Since December eleventh.
2317,580,2317,"Yes, I saw one the day after my primary care physician, but my legs gave out and I fell while walking to my car because of the leg weakness and back pain."
2318,580,2318,"He did a C T and x rays of my lower back, but he didn't see anything wrong. He recommended I follow up at U I H C. The imaging was on my L S Spine."
2319,581,2319,Is there a treatment for my right leg?
2320,583,2320,"Yes sir, that's right. I've seen him for years."
2321,583,2321,"Yes, doctor. That's all right."
2322,583,2322,"Well, I got stung by a Yellow Jacket Wasp yesterday."
2323,583,2323,"Yes, it's in my right hand and right arm."
2324,583,2324,"Yeah, this wouldn't be the first time."
2325,583,2325,"Yeah, I have. I have had one severe reaction. I came because I wanted to make sure it didn't get to that point again. I've never had, um, anaphylaxis, nothing super serious to date."
2326,583,2326,"No, it's never felt like it was going to close up or anything like that."
2327,583,2327,"No, I don't have anything like that either."
2328,583,2328,"Yes, that's really all, doctor."
2329,584,2329,"Um, it was around June third of two thousand nine."
2330,584,2330,"Yes I have, but I am not sure if it is finished, because I am still bleeding."
2331,584,2331,Do you want me to do a pregnancy test?
2332,584,2332,Okay.
2333,586,2333,Thank you.
2334,586,2334,"Okay. I have high blood pressure, asthma and sleep apnea. I had blood clots in my left leg about six months ago. I also have cancer."
2335,586,2335,I have stomach cancer. They also did a total abdominal hysterectomy.
2336,586,2336,Yes. I took it for six months. I stopped taking it and then I had the stroke.
2337,586,2337,Yes. I had a colonic resection to remove benign polyps. I had another benign lump removed from my breast.
2338,586,2338,"I am still having weakness in my left leg. That is why I still have to us my walker, but I have been able to get around easier."
2339,586,2339,No. I have been falling asleep at work. I think it is from looking at my computer screen all day. My supervisor caught me snoring one day and forgot where I was at. My supervisor offered to give me a coffee. This has happened more than once.
2340,586,2340,Doctor X did a consult and had me do one of those sleep test about two years ago. I only get sleepy when I look at my computer screen.
2341,586,2341,"Yes, but I never used to use it. I had another follow up visit with her and she told me that I need to use it every night. I have been using it every other night."
2342,586,2342,"Maybe two to five hours, on a good night."
2343,586,2343,Okay. I will make a follow up visit with her.
2344,587,2344,Yes I think so. That is how they treated it in the past.
2345,587,2345,Oh I am by myself.
2346,587,2346,No I do not.
2347,587,2347,Okay.
2348,588,2348,Not doing that good. I'm here so that you can help me.
2349,588,2349,"I have gestational diabetes and I'm here for consultation related to my diet. No matter what I eat, I'm kind of scared that it will spike up my numbers."
2350,588,2350,Sorry. I am thirty eight.
2351,588,2351,"No matter what I eat, my number goes up and I just, I'm so afraid of eating anything now."
2352,588,2352,"I do, at Walmart. I try not to eat anything whenever I'm on the third shift."
2353,588,2353,"Well, before all this, I mean this gestational diabetes and pregnancy, I used to eat out a lot. Almost like every day. I like to eat rice a lot. It is like the staple food for me."
2354,588,2354,"Yeah, whenever I'm on my late shift, I work from ten in the night to seven in the morning. I try to avoid eating. And then I feel very fatigued and tired all the time. I also have young kids at home, so after finishing my duty here at in the morning I go home and then there are young children who keep me busy."
2355,588,2355,Around two to four hours at a time.
2356,588,2356,"Normally, it is the first thing that I do when I reach back home from my shift in the morning."
2357,589,2357,I am fifty six years old. I am here for this pain in my legs. It hurts mostly in the night.
2358,589,2358,"Yeah, it helps. Whenever I stand it just goes away."
2359,589,2359,It normally starts in my hips and then it goes down my leg and sometimes into my ankles as well.
2360,589,2360,"It all started after taking that medication. What is it called? Something with L? Yeah, Lipitor."
2361,589,2361,Sometimes I do sweat at night.
2362,589,2362,"Yeah, I do feel feverish and have nausea as well."
2363,589,2363,"They have been low for quite some time. You know, I have started going to Genesis in Wichita and I've been doing water aerobics. And you know what? Surprisingly, I have lost thirty pounds."
2364,589,2364,"Anywhere between a hundred to one hundred and twenty. I check them one and a half hours after meals as well. They are, they have been one hundred and eighty five regularly."
2365,589,2365,Yeah. I have a request to make. I will be coming for my diabetic checkup in one month. Can we do all the labs before that?
2366,589,2366,"I tried to control my cholesterol with diet, but it didn't help. I cannot keep on dieting. It is just not my thing. I have started eating more meat though. I feel full after that."
2367,590,2367,Yes.
2368,590,2368,"Yes, I do have seven. I have a handful."
2369,590,2369,"Yeah, I'm a driver for FedEx."
2370,590,2370,Nope.
2371,590,2371,Nope. None of that.
2372,592,2372,Hello! It is nice to meet you.
2373,592,2373,My mother had breast cancer. My father had lung cancer that ended up taking his life. He was seventy nine when he passed. My mother also passed but not from an illness but from an infection she got after having an elective surgery.
2374,592,2374,Thank you. She was eighty one when she passed. I am an orphan now. My only living sibling died at forty. He had a hard life. He struggled with mental illness.
2375,592,2375,"He had pancreatitis. Oh, my dad had glaucoma."
2376,592,2376,"Yes, I have. My good friend passed away a year and a half ago. It has been a lot."
2377,592,2377,Yes. I would like that. Thank you.
2378,593,2378,Hm
2379,593,2379,"Well, I am forty seven and would proudly call myself as Latin American."
2380,593,2380,I had a blood test before and then it came out to be high potassium. I also went to a regular clinic the other day as I was feeling very weak and extremely tired.
2381,593,2381,"My potassium came out to be seven and it was highlighted in red. That really scared me, so I wanted to know everything what's going on inside me. I told the emergency doctors too that all these weakness and tiredness is going on for more than half a year."
2382,593,2382,"Yes, there was the fever and chills. I was sweating a lot in the nights, and I also had weight loss of around twenty pounds. During that time, I sometimes have nausea and was throwing up a lot. I was not eating. I always felt dizzy every time I tried to stand."
2383,593,2383,"No, not wet cough but I did notice back pain gets intense on the upper side whenever I coughed, like in my ribs. I normally massage that area and it gets better."
2384,593,2384,Nope.
2385,593,2385,"Not while sleeping, but I did notice that if I'm walking for two to three blocks then I get out of breath easily. Previously it was not like this. I used to jog for two to three miles without even a single breath loss."
2386,593,2386,I noticed one more thing. I feel like my balls on one side are getting big.
2387,593,2387,I think its left.
2388,593,2388,"I guess over the past year. I did see someone when all of this started, and he put me on some antibiotics, but nothing changed. For last few months there is yellow fluid coming out of it too."
2389,593,2389,No.
2390,593,2390,Nope everything is as usual.
2391,593,2391,Nope.
2392,593,2392,"Nope, no changes."
2393,593,2393,"Nope, no pain anywhere."
2394,594,2394,"Yeah, I've had a few. First, I had, um, tubal ligation, and three milk ducts removed."
2395,594,2395,"That was in, um, nineteen seventy nine."
2396,594,2396,"I had a breast biopsy in nineteen eighty nine, and a colonoscopy in two thousand seven."
2397,594,2397,"Well, doctor, I've been pregnant four times, but I've had three children."
2398,594,2398,"No, doctor. I had a natural birth for all of them."
2399,595,2399,No.
2400,596,2400,Yes just molds.
2401,597,2401,"I am fine, thank you.
Guest_family: Hi Doctor, I am her mother."
2402,597,2402,"Thank you doctor, it was nice meeting you."
2403,598,2403,Yes.
2404,598,2404,No I do not. But it should be in the chart.
2405,599,2405,"Good morning, doctor. Yes, that's correct."
2406,599,2406,"Yes, that's correct as well."
2407,599,2407,"Yes, I have diabetes."
2408,599,2408,"Well, I've had diabetes for a long time but had never been treated for it."
2409,599,2409,"I've been working in my garage over the past few days, and I have this redness and swelling in my right foot."
2410,599,2410,"Yes, and it's getting worse."
2411,599,2411,"Um, yes. I went to the A B C D General Hospital E R and they gave me an evaluation there."
2412,599,2412,"Um, yes. I have them right here."
2413,599,2413,But what about all the stuff on the outside of my foot?
2414,599,2414,What's that?
2415,599,2415,What kind of procedure can we do?
2416,599,2416,"Yes, I agree, doctor."
2417,600,2417,I'm flustered. I brought my wife so she can speak for me.
2418,601,2418,"Yes, to my wonderful husband."
2419,601,2419,"Yes, he is just wonderful."
2420,601,2420,"No, I don't do any of that."
2421,601,2421,"No, absolutely not."
2422,602,2422,"No doctor, everything else is fine."
2423,602,2423,Yes I am sure.
2424,604,2424,It's been on and off for a few days now. I'm also having chills.
2425,604,2425,Tylenol and Advil. I've been taking them interchangeably.
2426,604,2426,An hour ago. The thermometer read one O one point four.
2427,604,2427,I've been having a stronger urge to pee a lot more than usual. Not sure if that's related.
2428,604,2428,No.
2429,604,2429,Nothing of the sort.
2430,604,2430,Nope.
2431,604,2431,"Luckily, no. I don't have seizures or anything like that."
2432,604,2432,I have always been a homebody. This is normal for me. Nothing like that in my head.
2433,604,2433,Nothing like that.
2434,605,2434,Of course. Go ahead.
2435,605,2435,"No, I finally stopped smoking cigarettes."
2436,605,2436,I did. I smoked a half a pack for about twenty years.
2437,605,2437,I agree. I need to change up my lifestyle.
2438,605,2438,"No, I don't. I don't like anything that has alcohol. I can't stand the taste of it. If I do it is rare."
2439,606,2439,"Let me think. Now, it's been about four months. I just turned fifty nine."
2440,606,2440,Which toes did I break?
2441,606,2441,Do you have the x rays? Can I see where the breaks are?
2442,606,2442,"Wow, that's right where it hurts."
2443,606,2443,"Thankfully, I left the nursing home, and I'm back in my own house now."
2444,606,2444,"No, not today."
2445,606,2445,"Yeah, I've been going about two or three times a week."
2446,606,2446,"Nope, the wound healed up nicely. I'll be able to wear shorts again."
2447,606,2447,"No, but I have had some tingling in both my feet. I don't know if its related to surgery. If I'm remembering the names right, um, I have a history of spinal stenosis and neuropathy in my legs."
2448,607,2448,Quit in nineteen seventy two.
2449,607,2449,"Yeah, I work at a nursing home."
2450,607,2450,"Yeah, my job is very supportive. I've actually been trying to lose weight. So far, I've lost a good amount since starting a new diet several months back."
2451,608,2451,Can we reschedule? I'm too scared to do it.
2452,608,2452,Never. What if something goes wrong?
2453,608,2453,"Thank you, Doctor. Let's get started then."
2454,609,2454,I don't really remember anyone having any major health problems.
2455,609,2455,Everyone is pretty healthy.
2456,609,2456,"Yeah, it is."
2457,610,2457,"Hey, Doctor. My headaches have been getting worse."
2458,610,2458,I don't think so.
2459,611,2459,"Yeah, I am."
2460,611,2460,"Yeah, that's it."
2461,611,2461,"Yes, doctor. Here you go."
2462,611,2462,"Well, I'm having some aches and pains in my hands and elbows."
2463,611,2463,It's been a few weeks now.
2464,611,2464,"No, no falls or anything. It just started one day, and it's really bothering me."
2465,611,2465,"No, I'm not."
2466,611,2466,"No, everything is normal there. Of note, I have been losing a lot of hair recently."
2467,612,2467,"No, actually. I try to steer clear of drinking while training for my marathon."
2468,612,2468,Next summer.
2469,612,2469,Thank you.
2470,612,2470,Nope.
2471,613,2471,Thank you.
2472,613,2472,I have a lot of diabetes in the family.
2473,613,2473,My father had diabetes. He passed away.
2474,613,2474,He had cancer. He actually had breast cancer.
2475,613,2475,"Yes, she is. She just had her eighty ninth birthday. Next year we are going to plan a big birthday bash for her."
2476,613,2476,Yes. I have a sister. She has diabetes too.
2477,613,2477,No. I don't know of anything like that.
2478,615,2478,No.
2479,615,2479,No.
2480,616,2480,"Yes, this is my mommy."
2481,616,2481,"Well, I was running when I twisted my ankle."
2482,616,2482,It was my right ankle.
2483,616,2483,"Right here, on the outside of my ankle."
2484,616,2484,"No, it's just my ankle really."
2485,617,2485,"Hello, doctor."
2486,617,2486,"I'm in middle school, um, I'm in the eighth grade."
2487,617,2487,"Yes, I love to play basketball."
2488,617,2488,"Yes, I live with my mom and dad."
2489,617,2489,"Yes, I have a little brother, um, he's nine now."
2490,617,2490,"Um, yes, my first one was in September."
2491,618,2491,I was blessed with four beautiful children.
2492,618,2492,"Actually, I had two c sections for both of my sons."
2493,619,2493,I'm right handed.
2494,619,2494,"I'm having these cramps in my feet, in my hand and I just wanted to get checked. It has been happening for like six months. I develop muscle contractions in my toes and both feet. It only happens in night."
2495,619,2495,Around three times a week.
2496,619,2496,"I try to stand and it helps me relieve some of the discomfort. I noticed my toes are kind of extended. Whenever I step on the ground, it seems to pop into place. With all these cramps, I've started having pain in my calf. Sometimes because of that I could not sleep, or it wakes me up in the night. Similar to my toes, these cramps have also started coming up in my hands. They are not that strong or frequent. They're completely random and not in the nighttime. Sometimes my thumb gets so flexed that I have to move it to bring it to the right position and to relieve the cramp."
2497,619,2497,"No, not like this."
2498,619,2498,"Yeah, I took an antibacterial called Bactrim around nine months ago. I was taking it briefly before, but now I'm taking it consistently. I cannot think of anything that is causing it."
2499,619,2499,I have H I V for the last twenty one years and I was taking antiretroviral medications for it. I stopped those medications around six or seven years ago.
2500,619,2500,I could not tolerate them. They were making my stomach weak.
2501,619,2501,It was three hundred and twenty six. I never developed autoimmune deficiency syndrome. I think I should restart my medicines.
2502,620,2502,"Yes, it's the follow up. Lamictal was okay. There was no side effect with that. But I had twitching in my muscles a lot of times. It was not generalized, but I was very afraid that this will happen."
2503,620,2503,Mostly in the mornings.
2504,620,2504,I have been taking my medications very regularly and  I was getting a good amount of sleep as well.
2505,620,2505,Yes.
2506,620,2506,Looks same to me.
2507,621,2507,I had gall bladder and appendix surgery then they also took out my ovaries.
2508,622,2508,"Yeah, I have, I actually had it to repair an undescended testicle."
2509,622,2509,"No, nothing about it, I had that done when I was a baby."
2510,623,2510,I don't smoke cigarettes but I do have one on a rare occasion.
2511,623,2511,"I don't drink but I do occasionally smoke weed. 
Guest_family: He has a drink every now and again when we get together with friends."
2512,624,2512,"No, neither."
2513,624,2513,"No, I have never used any illegal drugs in my life."
2514,626,2514,"Yeah we didn't, it slipped out of my mind.
Guest_family: My father has a history of depression and anxiety."
2515,627,2515,Not good.
2516,627,2516,This ulcer in my ankle is just not healing.
2517,627,2517,"No, just on the right side."
2518,628,2518,"No, can you remind me?"
2519,628,2519,Thank you for reminding me.
2520,628,2520,"Yes, they said it was Gleason, um, three plus four."
2521,628,2521,"I'm taking Lupron, currently."
2522,629,2522,"Well, I have four children, all healthy with no medical conditions."
2523,629,2523,"My father passed away at the age of sixty nine due to C V A. And my mom died exactly ten years later, her heart just suddenly stopped. She was seventy nine."
2524,629,2524,"Well, believe it or not I had eleven siblings, including me twelve."
2525,629,2525,"Yes, I lost six of them. Four of them to diabetes, one of my brothers passed away at the age of seventy two and we could never determine the reason my sister died."
2526,630,2526,"Yes, they told me I might have C Diff?"
2527,631,2527,"I am good, how are you? I am seventy two years old."
2528,631,2528,"Actually, there is a wooden splinter stuck beneath my left fifth fingernail. I am an American farmer by blood, so this has happened before."
2529,631,2529,Yesterday evening around four P M.
2530,631,2530,"Then I tried to remove it with tweezers at home, but it did not come out. So, I want you to remove this."
2531,631,2531,"Yeah, here."
2532,631,2532,Oh it's been so long. I would say it has been over ten years since I have had any tetanus shot.
2533,631,2533,Oh yes. I am allergic to horse serum. I think it is added in vaccinations?
2534,631,2534,But I don't want any tetanus vaccine now.
2535,631,2535,"I know, but I get a bad reaction to vaccines so I don't want it."
2536,631,2536,Thanks.
2537,632,2537,I had a flu shot last winter but I have not had and recent vaccines.
2538,632,2538,I was going to get another flu shot but I don't think I am due for that for another three months.
2539,633,2539,Seventy one.
2540,633,2540,Right handed.
2541,633,2541,"I, I had this bad headache on fifth of November and then I had a big sneeze, like it was too loud. I had-- it was going on for like three to four days. Then, on the seventh, I had this severe pain over my left eye and I kind of lost my vision there."
2542,633,2542,"Yeah, on the following day, it seemed like swelling and then my eyelid, it began like pulling down and getting down. Kind of drooping. We went to a local doctor, and he did some x rays."
2543,633,2543,"Yeah, after looking at this report they transferred us here to the U I H C on the twelfth."
2544,634,2544,Yep. I ran out of Klonopin one or two days ago.
2545,634,2545,Panic attacks. I have really bad episodes without it. Um I think I started it about four months ago. I could be wrong though. I've lost track of time.
2546,634,2546,My doctor back in Georgia.
2547,634,2547,"No, unfortunately."
2548,634,2548,I take a pretty low dose. I think I'm on zero point five milligrams a day. Is there any way you could verify the dosage?
2549,634,2549,Over two months ago I think.
2550,634,2550,"Okay, thank you."
2551,634,2551,"Not right now, no. I did have some nausea yesterday. Oh and I guess I had a slight headache when I woke up this morning, but that's about it."
2552,635,2552,I'm doing fine. I hurt my hand the other day.
2553,635,2553,"My husband and I moved into our new home, and we were building a desk. I tried to nail something in, and I hammered my hand."
2554,635,2554,Yeah. We do. We just got married.
2555,636,2555,"Man, what a night."
2556,636,2556,I was driving my small sports car through an intersection when another car hit me from the left side. The impact forced my car off the road and into a utility pole.
2557,636,2557,"Yeah, I had my belt on and everything."
2558,636,2558,"Unfortunately, the driver was drunk and ran a traffic signal."
2559,636,2559,If I had to guess maybe eighty miles per hour. It looks like the driver who hit me was already cited by police.
2560,636,2560,"Yeah, I briefly lost consciousness when help arrived at the scene. I felt an immediate headache when I regained consciousness. I also had lower back and neck pain."
2561,636,2561,"Yeah, I got out by myself. Once I made it out, the Rescue Squad drove me to Saint Thomas Memorial Hospital. I was seen in the emergency room and later discharged."
2562,636,2562,Yessir.
2563,637,2563,"Good for the most part. I'm still pretty tired most days, but I'm trying to stay more active. I'm wondering if it has to do with my sugar levels?"
2564,637,2564,And oh I've noticed some blood in my stool. I'm not sure if it's related.
2565,637,2565,Maybe a week or so?
2566,637,2566,"No, none of that."
2567,637,2567,Can I do this at the blood work place?
2568,637,2568,Okay. I'll try to go in tomorrow.
2569,637,2569,"Okay, got it."
2570,637,2570,Oh shoot. I still need to do that. I'll call them tomorrow.
2571,638,2571,My knees hurt. They've been slowly getting worse each year. Life's getting hard at seventy two.
2572,638,2572,I have. Both knees are messed up.
2573,638,2573,Nope. I just sit all day.
2574,638,2574,What's that?
2575,638,2575,I'm up for it. I need to get my life going.
2576,638,2576,"Oh, yeah. These knees are making my life terrible."
2577,640,2577,"Hello, doctor. It was about a week ago now."
2578,640,2578,"Yes, that all sounds familiar. What's M U A?"
2579,640,2579,"Oh, wow."
2580,640,2580,"Overall, my pain is under control."
2581,640,2581,"No, nothing like that at all."
2582,640,2582,"Yeah, nothing like that."
2583,640,2583,"Okay, good. I was getting worried."
2584,640,2584,"Yes, doctor. I am."
2585,640,2585,"No, doctor. I don't have any of that."
2586,641,2586,I'm good. Thank you.
2587,641,2587,Eighty four.
2588,641,2588,I had a fall. And I was told to consult you for my heart conditions.
2589,641,2589,"Yeah, I have high blood pressure. And they also diagnosed me with other heart diseases. I cannot pronounce all the names I don't remember."
2590,641,2590,Wow! Those are a lot of fancy words that I can never remember.
2591,641,2591,What does it mean?
2592,641,2592,"Hm, okay."
2593,641,2593,"I'm not sure about how it happened, but yeah, I fell yesterday on my driveway and kind of hit a rock."
2594,641,2594,Um I think it was left side.
2595,641,2595,They gave me some medicine. And they put something on my finger. They said that my heart rate was very high.
2596,641,2596,They also did the same test this morning.
2597,641,2597,"I felt that I just ran in a race. I could feel all the pain after that fall. It was ugly. My heart was pounding so fast it was ready to come out, I never felt like that before in my life."
2598,641,2598,"No, it was just after fall. It did not stay like that for long, I was normal later. I never felt it again after that incident."
2599,641,2599,I don't think so.
2600,641,2600,Nope.
2601,641,2601,"No, not even before the fall. I'm able to walk and I'm sure I can climb stairs. Maybe two floors without any problems."
2602,642,2602,I drink sometimes. I've never smoked.
2603,642,2603,No.
2604,642,2604,"Uh I was back in Haiti, but that was back in eighty two. I had several male partners, but no sex since moving here."
2605,642,2605,"Most of the time, yes."
2606,642,2606,No.
2607,642,2607,Yep. I work for a car dealership down the street.
2608,643,2608,"Yeah, occasionally."
2609,643,2609,Just a regular pain medicine.
2610,644,2610,"Yes, that's correct."
2611,644,2611,"Yeah, I'm fifty five, so I'm not too young anymore, but I have developed iron deficiency anemia with blood in my stool. At least, that's what she's told me so far."
2612,644,2612,"Yeah, I am."
2613,644,2613,I'd say it's chronic at this point.
2614,644,2614,"Um, it's been a few months now."
2615,644,2615,"I had, um, an unusual pruritus, and I had a C B C."
2616,644,2616,"Yes, right here."
2617,644,2617,Are those high?
2618,644,2618,"Oh, okay."
2619,644,2619,"Um, it's been about five months now."
2620,644,2620,"Well, it's been both dark and bright blood, actually?"
2621,644,2621,"It was about three years ago, I had it with Doctor X. I did it in Las Cruces."
2622,644,2622,"Yeah, I had polyps removed."
2623,644,2623,"Yeah, the doctors said they were, um, hyperplastic. They diagnosed me with, um, lymphocytic colitis."
2624,644,2624,"At this point, it's been more than three years."
2625,645,2625,"I identify as a female, and I use she her pronouns."
2626,645,2626,"Yes, I actually have a list of them written down."
2627,645,2627,"Absolutely, here you go."
2628,645,2628,"Yep, I got this list from all of the surgeons."
2629,645,2629,"Yes, actually, I have another list, um, I have polymyalgia rheumatica."
2630,646,2630,"Hi Doctor, I am fifty five now and would identify myself as a white male."
2631,646,2631,It was sometimes between two thousand and five and six.
2632,646,2632,Yes.
2633,646,2633,"Oh, it was a terrible time, I could not deal with anyone of them. I had numbness and tingling with burning pain in my hands."
2634,646,2634,That's right!
2635,646,2635,"We had some medications here as well when I first started my care here, I forgot the name."
2636,646,2636,"Yes, I had severe diarrhea and I always felt tired like I have no energy left in me. Eventually it all stopped."
2637,646,2637,"It all happened last week, I injured this left leg and got swelling. I had some prescribed steroids, so I took them for about three days only. The swelling is eventually gone now."
2638,646,2638,No.
2639,646,2639,"I take marijuana. I feel really hungry after smoking it, so I eat a lot. In just the last few weeks I have gained a few pounds."
2640,647,2640,"Nope. Fortunately, no one in my family has neurological problems."
2641,648,2641,Not long. Less than a day if I had to guess.
2642,648,2642,"No, it's just really itchy. I tried applying Cortisone to it, but it didn't help much."
2643,648,2643,Yeah. I've only noticed it on my left arm.
2644,649,2644,Hi. I'm five years old. My birthday is in four months.
2645,651,2645,"I had a little accident with a dog, he bit me. I got really scared."
2646,652,2646,"Um, I was peeing blood, it's back again."
2647,652,2647,"No, not that I know of."
2648,652,2648,"Yes, I have been."
2649,652,2649,"Yes, I've been taking that too. It has been held recently, but I ususally take it."
2650,652,2650,I have A F I B and stroke.
2651,652,2651,"Yes, doctor."
2652,652,2652,"Yeah, actually I fell about a week ago."
2653,652,2653,It's in my butt and leg.
2654,652,2654,"Yeah, the x ray tech just brought me back."
2655,652,2655,"What does that mean, doctor?"
2656,652,2656,"Can you tell me some good news, please?"
2657,652,2657,I guess that's something.
2658,652,2658,"It's so severe, and it's worst first thing in the morning."
2659,652,2659,"Yeah, I will. I'm having problems with my sinuses today too. Can I get some nasal spray too?"
2660,653,2660,"Good morning, Doctor."
2661,653,2661,"No sir, I'm happily single."
2662,653,2662,"I'm actually not working right now, I go to college full time."
2663,653,2663,"No, I don't."
2664,653,2664,"Absolutely not, nothing like that."
2665,653,2665,"I play tennis and swim every week, I love it."
2666,654,2666,Not that I'm aware of.
2667,654,2667,My mom died of a stroke.
2668,654,2668,She was sixty two.
2669,655,2669,Seventeen years back.
2670,655,2670,About one pack per day. I smoked for forty four years.
2671,655,2671,No I have not done that.
2672,657,2672,"Maybe, I might. What exactly do you mean by that, doctor?"
2673,657,2673,"Okay, that's what I thought. I have high blood pressure."
2674,657,2674,"Um, yeah, I have anxiety, too."
2675,658,2675,"Yes, I am. I go to the University."
2676,658,2676,Yes! I am studying biology.
2677,658,2677,Yes.
2678,658,2678,I am from Breckenridge. That is where my parents live.
2679,658,2679,"I have smoked weed with friends, off and on but not much. I have a few beers at the occasional dorm party."
2680,659,2680,"No, none."
2681,660,2681,"Hi there, how are you? I have a bad headache so can you please switch off the lights, it's too bright and uncomfortable."
2682,660,2682,Much better.
2683,661,2683,"Oh, I have very disturbing family history!"
2684,661,2684,"Well, my mother passed away due to heart attack in her late sixties and my father had liver cancer and he passed away from that."
2685,661,2685,"Oh, that is not all. My one son suffers from hypothyroidism and my daughter's two kids have cerebral palsy from being born prematurely."
2686,661,2686,Yeah.
2687,662,2687,"Hey, man."
2688,662,2688,"Yeah, it's been a while that's for sure."
2689,662,2689,Uh I had some stuff on my chest that I saw a dermatologist for.
2690,662,2690,I think they were cysts.
2691,662,2691,"Nah, the dermatologist said everything came back alright."
2692,662,2692,Me too. I'm actually here to see if you can write me up a P P D slip.
2693,662,2693,"Yeah, my last one was negative, but I need to get another one. Last one I did was in nineteen ninety four."
2694,664,2694,"No, ma'am. I am forty three and this is the first time I have had a major issue. It's only been this past month where I've felt weaker than usual. I'm much more tired and short of breath whenever I move around."
2695,664,2695,"Yeah, I actually lost about fifteen pounds in less than two or three months."
2696,664,2696,"Appetite is pretty fine. No nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea."
2697,664,2697,"No, ma'am."
2698,664,2698,"No, ma'am."
2699,665,2699,No I do not.
2700,665,2700,Yes I am.
2701,666,2701,Nothing that I know of.
2702,668,2702,No I do not.
2703,668,2703,Okay.
2704,668,2704,Are you only asking for medical allergies?
2705,670,2705,No.
2706,671,2706,Not great.
2707,671,2707,I've had a headache all week along with neck and lower back pain.
2708,671,2708,Throbbing pain.
2709,671,2709,It comes and goes for the most part.
2710,671,2710,A seven or eight.
2711,671,2711,"No, not right this second."
2712,671,2712,Anything for the pain?
2713,671,2713,"I took some Ibuprofen, but it doesn't seem to be helping much."
2714,671,2714,"No, not really. I don't feel like I have a cold or anything."
2715,671,2715,No.
2716,671,2716,"Eh I can't say. It's been bothering me for some time now, but the pain feels a bit different."
2717,671,2717,I don't really know. It's more pronounced.
2718,672,2718,"I do actually, I have back disc degeneration."
2719,672,2719,Yeah.
2720,672,2720,Maybe twenty ten?
2721,674,2721,"I remember having surgery as a child, but I don't know what the surgery was for. It was so long ago."
2722,675,2722,"Well, it's just me and my brother now. My mom passed away due to stroke at the age of seventy nine."
2723,675,2723,"My father had a good life with no medical conditions. He passed away due to old age, he was ninety one."
2724,675,2724,My other brother had prostate cancer but that's just it. No diabetes or heart issues.
2725,676,2725,"Oh yes, I am allergic to what you call Cipro-"
2726,676,2726,"Yes! And also, Asprin but that coated one, what is called?"
2727,676,2727,"Yes, yes, that one!"
2728,677,2728,Hello Doctor.
2729,677,2729,I am having a headache.
2730,678,2730,In the past I have been treated for osteomyelitis of my right fifth toe with I V antibiotics therapy.
2731,678,2731,"Ah, about five years back! I was treated for six weeks."
2732,678,2732,That is correct.
2733,679,2733,"Oh, yeah, I have a whole list of things going on, doctor."
2734,679,2734,"Well, I have high blood pressure, hypothyroidism, arthritis, and G E R D."
2735,679,2735,"Um, I have an anxiety disorder, and I had migraines about thirty years ago."
2736,679,2736,"Yeah, I have one on both feet."
2737,680,2737,No.
2738,680,2738,No.
2739,680,2739,No.
2740,680,2740,No.
2741,681,2741,"Well, my mom, dad, and I have four brothers aged eighteen, sixteen, fourteen and twelve and I also have a younger sister. She is only three."
2742,681,2742,"Yes, and we also have two dogs and two cats."
2743,681,2743,"Except for my mom!
Guest_family: Yeah, except for me thankfully."
2744,681,2744,"No, right mom? 
Guest_family: Yeah, we didn't travel anywhere recently."
2745,682,2745,"Yes, I am taking Atenolol and Mevacor."
2746,682,2746,Not that I know of.
2747,683,2747,That's great!
2748,685,2748,"Yeah, my mother said that I had to have surgery after she gave birth to me."
2749,685,2749,"I don't know if I have all of them written down, but I do have most of them here."
2750,685,2750,Yeah. I was hospitalized in nineteen seventy for a U T I. That is when the problems started happening. It was a really bad infection.
2751,685,2751,In nineteen eighty eight I the tissue removed from the anus. There was a blockage. They also did an operation in the shaft of the penis too.
2752,685,2752,It did. I have here in January of nineteen ninety one I had a cystoscopy to remove a blockage.
2753,685,2753,In two thousand and one I had a colonoscopy that was normal. Later that year I had a biopsy of my prostate.
2754,685,2754,They said I had severe inflammation in the prostate. I was never told that cause of the inflammation.
2755,685,2755,Oh yeah. I had that same procedure done again when I was twenty seven and twenty eight. The same one that I had as a newborn. I had a third surgery when I was seventy with just a correction of the shaft area.
2756,685,2756,Yeah. I have it written down here. In two thousand and one there was a left rotator cuff repair with acromioplasty and distal clavicle resection and in two thousand and three I had a left inguinal hernia repair with M E S H. That is what my notes say.
2757,685,2757,"Yeah, I did. I have a blood clot that apparently went into my lungs. I was very scary."
2758,686,2758,Yes that is right.
2759,687,2759,No.
2760,687,2760,No.
2761,687,2761,No.
2762,688,2762,"Hello, how are you?"
2763,688,2763,I think I am all well now.
2764,689,2764,I am twenty one.
2765,689,2765,I am right handed.
2766,689,2766,"Everything started on the fifth of November. Then after I saw the gradual increase in my symptoms. So it was all like numbness. I could not feel my legs. They felt numb all the time and there was no coordination between them, and it also affected my walk. All these symptoms were at their limit in just like a half day or more. It is continuing the same way since then. I also feel like somebody is putting pins and needles on my legs approximately  halfway up the calf on both sides."
2767,689,2767,"Yeah, that's right. It totally feels like I'm walking in space and don't know where to put my next step. I have no up and down spatial awareness."
2768,689,2768,Nope.
2769,689,2769,"No, it's only in the legs."
2770,689,2770,"Well, sometimes, you see, hot showers made me feel better, but it is like only sometimes."
2771,689,2771,Nope.
2772,689,2772,Nope.
2773,689,2773,Nope.
2774,689,2774,"No, no medical issues."
2775,689,2775,No medications.
2776,690,2776,"Well, I have had a progressive loss of my vision in my right eye. My eye doctor told me that I should come and see a neurologist. So here I am."
2777,690,2777,About two months. It seems like it has been progressing really fast. I have always had bad vision in my left eye. That started about two years ago.
2778,690,2778,No. I am considered blind in this eye now.
2779,690,2779,No.
2780,690,2780,Nope.
2781,690,2781,What do you mean?
2782,690,2782,Oh! I am right handed.
2783,690,2783,I am sixty two.
2784,690,2784,Okay.
2785,691,2785,No.
2786,691,2786,No.
2787,692,2787,"Sure, I know that my grandmother on my mom's side had pancreatic cancer, and my dad had prostate cancer."
2788,692,2788,"Um, I know that my dad had heart disease, as well as diabetes."
2789,693,2789,I am a registered nurse.
2790,693,2790,No sir.
2791,693,2791,Absolutely not!
2792,694,2792,"I am doing well, thanks. Just trying to come to you more regularly to make sure my lungs and heart are okay."
2793,694,2793,"Yes, I quit in nineteen ninety six. I come yearly to the doctor's office to make sure that the damage I did to my lungs is monitored."
2794,694,2794,Yeah. I smoked for a long time and I know it was bad for me. It was just the norm back in the day.
2795,694,2795,I do. Only occasionally.
2796,696,2796,"Okay, so what do you recommend?"
2797,696,2797,"Yes, my son and his family lives with me. They are very caring."
2798,697,2798,I'm a truck driver. It's a big construction company. I work for them.
2799,697,2799,Yeah.
2800,697,2800,I do Cigar.
2801,698,2801,"Good morning, doctor. Absolutely, that's not a problem at all."
2802,698,2802,"I don't smoke, and I drink, um, I'd say on occasionally."
2803,698,2803,"No, I don't."
2804,698,2804,"Yes, to my wonderful husband."
2805,698,2805,"I'm a social worker, and my husband is a high school chemistry teacher."
2806,698,2806,"I love it, I work with adult abuse and neglect issues."
2807,698,2807,"Yes, we have two sons."
2808,698,2808,"No, they're both grown and on their own now."
2809,699,2809,"Unfortunately, yes. My mom passed from a heart attack at seventy three and my father at eighty."
2810,699,2810,I lost my brother as well. He passed away from a brain tumor when he was nine years old.
2811,699,2811,"It was a dark time in our lives, but we survived it as a family."
2812,701,2812,Yes. I have been married for twenty two years.
2813,701,2813,No. I am unemployed. I have not completed my collage degree yet. I have been in school for the last two years.
2814,702,2814,I wanted to see if I could get some treatment for my pain.
2815,702,2815,I feel like it's a burning feeling? I don't know. I can feel it one spot and then it spreads down.
2816,702,2816,I feel it mostly on my lower right side of my back.
2817,702,2817,The back of my right leg and knee.
2818,702,2818,That's it. Radiating. I forgot the word.
2819,702,2819,They're both a ten.
2820,702,2820,Yes. Could you check my feet?
2821,702,2821,I feel like the bottom is numb. Ouch. It also feels sharp at times too.
2822,702,2822,"Ouch! It hurts a lot. I feel a sharp and dull pain. Most of the time, it's just aching."
2823,702,2823,I'd say when I'm sitting in a car for a long time.
2824,702,2824,"Yeah. When I stand and walk, too."
2825,702,2825,I am on a load of narcotics for the pain.
2826,703,2826,No.
2827,703,2827,No.
2828,703,2828,No.
2829,703,2829,No.
2830,703,2830,"No, nothing like that."
2831,703,2831,No.
2832,703,2832,"No, nothing of that sort."
2833,703,2833,Nope.
2834,703,2834,"No, nothing of that sort."
2835,703,2835,No.
2836,703,2836,That's correct.
2837,703,2837,No.
2838,703,2838,That is right.
2839,704,2839,"Yes. I have been having diarrhea. When I think about it, it started happening around the same time that the mouth sores started. I didn't have any diarrhea today though."
2840,704,2840,No.
2841,704,2841,No.
2842,705,2842,Yes.
2843,705,2843,Yes.
2844,705,2844,Yes I take that.
2845,705,2845,Yes.
2846,707,2846,"I am good, Doctor."
2847,707,2847,"Well, I have many medical issues and I see Doctor X for them, but I wanted a second opinion, so he referred me here."
2848,707,2848,Thank you.
2849,707,2849,"Sure, I had skin cancer which was treated by removal of that part."
2850,707,2850,"Other than that, I have anemia and an acid reflux problem. I also have history of C O P D."
2851,707,2851,I also suffer from sciatica which was caused mainly due to my arthritis.
2852,708,2852,"Good afternoon, doctor."
2853,708,2853,I'm having a lot of pain in my right heel.
2854,708,2854,"Um, it's been about two weeks now."
2855,708,2855,"Honestly, it starts with the first step first thing in the morning."
2856,708,2856,"Yes, it gets worse all day with activities."
2857,708,2857,"Well, nothing to date."
2858,708,2858,"It's on the right heel, then it's on the inside bottom part of the heel and into the inside of the heel."
2859,708,2859,"No, it's the same old same old."
2860,708,2860,Like fever or chills?
2861,708,2861,"Oh, no I don't have anything like that."
2862,708,2862,"Thankfully, no nothing like that."
2863,709,2863,My family has a high blood pressure. I have a family member that had colon cancer.  My daughter has a twitch. They don't know what caused it?
2864,710,2864,"Yes, it has been flaring."
2865,710,2865,"Sure, I'm twenty nine."
2866,710,2866,That's right.
2867,710,2867,I'm single.
2868,710,2868,"No, currently I'm unemployed."
2869,710,2869,"Yeah, I think so."
2870,710,2870,"I've been doing all that, but now it looks like my eczema is flaring. I have these cracks in my hands and they feel very dry."
2871,710,2871,"No, I was using soap. The Cetaphil cleansing lotion was not working.  I had a lot of pain and burning sensation whenever I tried to use that."
2872,710,2872,I have been wearing gloves as much as I can.
2873,711,2873,The one on my left wrist?
2874,711,2874,Yep.
2875,711,2875,Uh yeah. I've been using it much less now.
2876,711,2876,"Yeah, I mean I'm taking four M G in the morning and six M G at night instead of the six M G and eight M G that was recommended. I feel like I do better with the lower doses."
2877,712,2877,"Well, that's a relief!"
2878,712,2878,Great!
2879,714,2879,Thank you. It is nice to meet you.
2880,714,2880,Yes. I smoke cigarettes. I am working on quitting.
2881,714,2881,I smoke about a pack a day.
2882,714,2882,I drink but I don't do any drugs.
2883,714,2883,I drink about four drinks per night. I used to drink a lot more than that. I have cut back on my drinking.
2884,714,2884,I was very athletic when I was growing up. Now I don't exercise on a regular basis.
2885,714,2885,I am a network engineer. I work for Shepherd Pratt.
2886,714,2886,Yes. I have been married to my wife for five years now.
2887,714,2887,No. Just me and the wife.
2888,715,2888,I'm divorced.
2889,715,2889,"I live with my girlfriend, and we have a kid together. I also have three other kids from my former wife."
2890,715,2890,"I used to smoke. But I, I've quit like fifteen years ago."
2891,715,2891,"Yeah, I drink beer. Around one to two beers a day."
2892,715,2892,"I'm retired right now, but I used to work in an iron company."
2893,716,2893,"Yes, I do. Can I?"
2894,717,2894,Yes. I'm doing my major in computer science.
2895,717,2895,"No, I live in my family. Mainly my parents and my sisters."
2896,718,2896,"No, not that I know of."
2897,718,2897,"Unless they did it while I was sleeping, but none that I can remember."
2898,719,2898,"Sadly, yes. Stroke and dementia are the other two big ones."
2899,720,2899,Me?
2900,720,2900,"No, I am not."
2901,720,2901,"Yes, I am damn sure."
2902,722,2902,"Unfortunately, yes."
2903,722,2903,Um in the public area and my thighs.
2904,722,2904,Yeah. I've gotten about four I and D's.
2905,723,2905,"Fine, I guess. I'm being treated for I B S by my G I. Last time I was in, they told me that my white blood cell levels aren't where they were supposed to be."
2906,724,2906,What do you mean by that?
2907,724,2907,"Oh yeah, my mom has arthritis."
2908,725,2908,"Little bit, not so much."
2909,725,2909,Okay.
2910,725,2910,Okay I can do that.
2911,726,2911,"No, I am not allergic."
2912,726,2912,Yeah.
2913,728,2913,"Yeah, my father had it."
2914,728,2914,No.
2915,728,2915,"No, I don't smoke."
2916,728,2916,No.
2917,730,2917,"Oh, I do but occasionally. Who doesn't like a nice cocktail!"
2918,730,2918,"No, I don't smoke."
2919,731,2919,I have bad nausea.
2920,731,2920,And I feel very dizzy like I am going to faint.
2921,731,2921,Okay.
2922,732,2922,I had a stroke about a month ago. The right side of my face is still not moving.
2923,732,2923,Yes. It has improved a little bit since I was in the hospital.
2924,733,2924,"What, like smoke cigarettes?"
2925,733,2925,"Oh, no. I don't do anything like that."
2926,734,2926,"Yes, I had it for melanoma some time ago."
2927,734,2927,"Oh, yes, that's true. I had that done too."
2928,735,2928,"No, no one I can think of."
2929,735,2929,"No, not one person comes to mind."
2930,735,2930,"No, at least no one that I know of."
2931,735,2931,My aunt. She's had it for some time now.
2932,736,2932,"Yeah, I do have anxiety issues."
2933,737,2933,"Oh, you know, all of the fun ones. Like cappuccino, quiche, crescents, candy, vending machines, all of that stuff."
2934,737,2934,"Yes, I do about three or four times a week instead of eating out so much."
2935,737,2935,"Yes, I do about six or seven days a week."
2936,737,2936,"Well, I do just about everything. I swim, I bike, run and then I lift weights."
2937,737,2937,"Usually, it's about one and a half to two and a half hours every day."
2938,737,2938,"Actually, yes I'm going to do a triathlon."
2939,737,2939,"Yes, I am."
2940,739,2940,"Today it's about a six or seven, and it's usually pretty constant there."
2941,739,2941,"Yes, when it's cold out it turns to ten out of ten. It's better when it's warm out."
2942,739,2942,"Yes, it progressively gets worse and worse as the day goes on, but I also have a pretty hard time getting out of bed in the morning, too."
2943,739,2943,"Oh, it's ten out of ten."
2944,739,2944,"If I sleep at all. I'm not sleeping well at all, and when I do it's for less than an hour at a time."
2945,739,2945,"Yes, if I sit for more than about twenty minutes, or if I lay flat on my back."
2946,739,2946,Laying on my side helps a little.
2947,741,2947,"Yeah, I started taking Toprol and uh the one that starts with an A. I forget what it's called."
2948,741,2948,"Oh right, yeah that's the one."
2949,742,2949,"Good afternoon, doctor. I'm fifty six years old, now."
2950,742,2950,"Well, I need some support for dietary recommendations for healthy eating for my husband and me."
2951,742,2951,"Um, I have a lot going on, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, acid reflux, and I just want to lose some weight. My husband has high cholesterol too."
2952,742,2952,"Well, we live by ourselves now that our children are gone, but I'm used to cooking really large portions."
2953,742,2953,"Yes, that's a good way to put it. I'd like to just make less food, that way we're not so tempted to eat so much."
2954,742,2954,"Well, I start a new job this week."
2955,743,2955,"Hi! I have not been able to go pee, and I have had this sharp pain in my left side."
2956,743,2956,No.
2957,743,2957,No.
2958,743,2958,Okay.
2959,746,2959,"Ah no, it was on April eighth two thousand five, doctor."
2960,746,2960,"No, everything is the same really."
2961,747,2961,Nope.
2962,749,2962,Um uh who? Where am I?
2963,749,2963,I'm where?
2964,749,2964,I'm no longer at the bar?
2965,749,2965,I don't know what's going on. Can you call my girlfriend? She was there with me before we got into a fight.
2966,750,2966,"He's good. He usually comes with me to my appointments, but he had to run some errands this morning."
2967,750,2967,Me too.
2968,750,2968,"No, never."
2969,751,2969,"I am doing good, considering."
2970,751,2970,Yes.  I was able to get some good sleep last night.
2971,751,2971,Yes. I ate a little bit of breakfast this morning.
2972,751,2972,"Yes, I did this morning."
2973,751,2973,It was still a little difficult and hard.
2974,753,2974,No
2975,754,2975,I have it written down right here in my notes. It was in October of two thousand one.
2976,754,2976,"Yes, I have a beautiful daughter."
2977,754,2977,"Yes, I've just pregnant once and it was with my daughter."
2978,755,2978,I had both my tubes tied in O one and I had a polyp removed when I was fourteen.
2979,755,2979,"Oh, sorry I didn't mean to interrupt."
2980,755,2980,"Yes, it was."
2981,757,2981,All over my torso and arms.
2982,757,2982,"Well, it started on my back and then it made its way to my torso and arms."
2983,757,2983,Yes.
2984,757,2984,"Nope. I mean I did remove some insulation in my basement a few days ago, but I didn't feel itchy that day."
2985,757,2985,No.
2986,758,2986,As in drugs?
2987,758,2987,Oh yeah. I'm allergic to Sulfa drugs.
2988,758,2988,Break out in a terrible rash. I remember I had to go to the E R the first and last time I took it.
2989,758,2989,"Yeah, so no more Sulfa drugs for me. That's for sure."
2990,759,2990,Yes.
2991,759,2991,"Honestly, I smoke every day."
2992,760,2992,"Yeah, my mother died of heart attack. She was seventy years old. My father died of cancer; it was prostate cancer. He was around eighty."
2993,760,2993,"Hm, my brother had both heart disorder and prostate cancer and he died around seventy four."
2994,761,2994,Right above my belly button. It's been bothering me for three weeks now.
2995,761,2995,"Um it's pretty constant, but it does seem to get worse at night."
2996,761,2996,Eh not really. I can't seem to really get comfortable since it started.
2997,761,2997,I uh-
2998,761,2998,"Um I took Pepto Bismol a few times, but that didn't do much."
2999,761,2999,Yeah.
3000,762,3000,"Good morning, doctor."
3001,762,3001,"Well, I've had depression for a while now."
3002,763,3002,"Good afternoon, doctor."
3003,763,3003,"Right now, actually, I'm not working."
3004,763,3004,"No, I'm happily single right now."
3005,763,3005,"No, I don't have any, its just me."
3006,763,3006,"No, I don't do any of that."
3007,763,3007,"No, I absolutely do not."
3008,763,3008,"Today, I'd say its about an eight out of ten."
3009,764,3009,My head has been hurting a lot.
3010,764,3010,I'm ready for less pain. Let's go.
3011,765,3011,"Okay, sounds good."
3012,766,3012,My dad's mom has diabetes and hypertension and my dad's dad had emphysema and he was a smoker.
3013,766,3013,Yeah.
3014,766,3014,"No, there isn't."
3015,766,3015,No.
3016,767,3016,"I kind of knew it was a U T I. I have had it before, but nothing this painful and severe. I feel like I am going to die!"
3017,767,3017,"Well, is it because of my diabetes?"
3018,767,3018,Yes!
3019,767,3019,"Yeah, sometimes I don't care about my diet."
3020,767,3020,"Alright, thank you!"
3021,768,3021,"Good morning, doctor."
3022,768,3022,"Yes, I got a few. I had strep throat, mumps, and, um, chickenpox growing up."
3023,769,3023,Hello! It is nice to meet you.
3024,769,3024,Yes. I am nervous.
3025,769,3025,Okay.
3026,770,3026,Claritin.
3027,770,3027,For my allergic rhinitis.
3028,771,3028,Nope. None that I know of.
3029,772,3029,My dad had a heart attack and passed away at sixty one.
3030,772,3030,Thank you.
3031,772,3031,No. None that I know of. Everyone is relatively healthy.
3032,773,3032,I feel terrible. Very sick and I can barely move. I feel so weak.
3033,774,3033,Sure.
3034,774,3034,Okay.
3035,775,3035,Thank you.
3036,775,3036,Yes. It has been almost a year since the pain first started.
3037,775,3037,I still have this dull pain in my upper outer area of my arm.
3038,775,3038,"It was coming and going, but now the pain is more persistent since I last saw you. It is still happening every day."
3039,775,3039,Yeah. It makes is hard to do things with the persistent pain.
3040,775,3040,"No, but I have had this achy sensation in my hand radiating down to my fingers."
3041,775,3041,It is not from a specific injury but I have had this neck pain for thirty years.
3042,775,3042,"Yes. I saw someone for it in two thousand and six, and then I developed this ear pain. They could not figure out what was going on so eventually I was sent to have an M R I of my neck and upper spine, which showed some degenerative changes. Then I was referred to Doctor X who was treating me for neck pain.  He gave me steroid injections."
3043,775,3043,Yes. I have been seeing him since two thousand and seven.
3044,775,3044,I am fifty eight.
3045,775,3045,"Those are for neck pain. My arm pain recent. I have been having the injections for a while now, without any trouble."
3046,775,3046,There are a few of them that I take. I gave the list to the nurse.
3047,775,3047,I also have taken several Medrol packs. They make my blood sugars to increase so I try not to take it.
3048,775,3048,"No. I can do everything like normal, but constant nagging pain does get to me at times."
3049,776,3049,I had a C section for my kiddo and one D and C.
3050,777,3050,No.
3051,778,3051,To any medications? No allergies here.
3052,779,3052,Hi!
3053,779,3053,That's great news.
3054,780,3054,Yes. I did fall.
3055,780,3055,I don't really know. I have balancing problems. I have been to my P C P for this issue a few days ago. I saw her about a week and a half ago because I had another fall. Maybe around late December since today is January seventh.  I have been having trouble with my right hand. It is like I am clumsy on my right side. I ended up falling because my right hand missed the railing when I grabbed it to head up the stairs.
3056,780,3056,Right.
3057,780,3057,"Yes, it is only on my right side. It is like the right side of my body is weak and it has been getting worse."
3058,780,3058,About two years.
3059,780,3059,Yes. Every once and a while.
3060,780,3060,I just turned fifty eight last week.
3061,780,3061,Thank you!
3062,780,3062,"Yes, she did. She did both. She said she would send my records over."
3063,780,3063,No.
3064,780,3064,"So, are the masses cancer?"
3065,780,3065,Okay.
3066,781,3066,"Yes, I do."
3067,781,3067,"Yes sure, I smoke half a pack a day."
3068,781,3068,"No, I do not drink or use. I have a five month old baby."
3069,782,3069,"Well, out of ten, I'd say it's about a seven."
3070,782,3070,"Um, I'd say it's deep, and it really aches."
3071,782,3071,"It's in my right lower back, and then into my butt."
3072,782,3072,"I can't go up and down stairs without a lot of pain, and it hurts when I sit for a long time, like when I drive."
3073,782,3073,I was very active before all this started.
3074,782,3074,"Not really, I'm having a lot of problems with stuff around the house, like all the chores and projects I used to be able to do."
3075,783,3075,Thank you.
3076,783,3076,I have some memory loss problems.
3077,783,3077,"Well, I have seizures."
3078,783,3078,I have temporal lobe seizures.
3079,783,3079,I also have high blood pressure.
3080,784,3080,Nope.
3081,784,3081,"No, I never had a surgery."
3082,785,3082,I am seventy three.
3083,785,3083,Right.
3084,785,3084,"I was not able to take on with my usual task of flower arrangements or dealing with the cash at the cash register. 
Guest_family: She quit the next day, and she never went back."
3085,786,3085,"No, I am not."
3086,786,3086,"No, I am not allergic to anything."
3087,787,3087,Yeah.
3088,789,3088,I have been having some severe bruising. I have been taking Coumadin for three months now. Am I taking to much Coumadin?
3089,789,3089,Okay.
3090,790,3090,Um no.
3091,790,3091,No.
3092,790,3092,"No, no chest pain and shortness of breath."
3093,790,3093,No.
3094,790,3094,No and no.
3095,790,3095,No.
3096,790,3096,No.
3097,790,3097,"No, no really."
3098,790,3098,No.
3099,790,3099,Nope.
3100,790,3100,"No, just normal."
3101,790,3101,Yes.
3102,790,3102,No.
3103,790,3103,"Well, my frequency is normal. I don't have to wake up at night for urinating."
3104,790,3104,"No, it's absolutely normal."
3105,790,3105,Nope.
3106,790,3106,"Yes, no wheezing."
3107,790,3107,No.
3108,790,3108,Um no.
3109,790,3109,No.
3110,790,3110,Oh yes!
3111,790,3111,"No, not really."
3112,790,3112,No.
3113,791,3113,Yes I am fine.
3114,791,3114,Thanks.
3115,792,3115,"Yes, that's right."
3116,792,3116,"Well, I'm having some increased paranoia."
3117,792,3117,"Yes, and it's actually gotten a lot better with the medicine another doctor gave me."
3118,794,3118,"Uh no, no treatments whatsoever. I mean I do find myself in low moods every now and again when I'm dealing with certain stressors, but the decreased moods rarely ever long lasting."
3119,795,3119,"I don't remember what month, but it was in nineteen ninety nine."
3120,795,3120,"Let me look at my notes here, um, it was in nineteen ninety six."
3121,795,3121,"Let me think, my dad is still around, he had a stroke. Oh yeah, and he has high blood pressure."
3122,795,3122,He's seventy nine now.
3123,795,3123,"She died when she was seventy four, she had heart failure and emphysema."
3124,795,3124,"Thank you doctor, no, its just me and my Dad now."
3125,796,3125,I'm doing just fine.
3126,796,3126,Nope.
3127,796,3127,Nope.
3128,796,3128,No.
3129,796,3129,"No, sir. I had issues with my knees, and they had to put in the new ones. I was kind of disabled and that's why I retired."
3130,797,3130,"No, I don't."
3131,797,3131,"Yes, I do get breathless only when I have to do some form of exertion like walking a long time or running."
3132,797,3132,"No, I don't have any stomach problems except I have to go frequently to use a bathroom."
3133,797,3133,No nothing like that.
3134,799,3134,Yes in fact I came in walking.
3135,799,3135,I am having a bellyache.
3136,799,3136,"Oh, it's been a while now."
3137,799,3137,Ok so the pain started as dullache but it is constant right here in the middle upper part of my stomach. And sometimes it is moving to the back.
3138,799,3138,"Sure, so i do get episodes of stabbing pain but they are not related to meals. Once the wave comes it lasts for only a minute or so."
3139,799,3139,"Approximately six months back. I took over the counter antacids and got some relief so i did not go to doctor. But two months back it got worse, I do get occasional nausea and vomiting."
3140,799,3140,Yeah that's right.
3141,799,3141,Do you know I lost twenty pound of weight since all these symptoms began but i have been also admitted for poor appetite.
3142,799,3142,I get two to three loose bowel movements a day but no blood in stool or anywhere.
3143,799,3143,"No no, nothing like that."
3144,799,3144,"No position changing have no effect, no fever or anything."
3145,799,3145,Yes I have had very active and healthy lifestyle.
3146,800,3146,No.
3147,800,3147,No.
3148,800,3148,No.
3149,801,3149,"My mother has high blood pressure, and she had a stroke last year."
3150,801,3150,Yeah. She is doing well.
3151,801,3151,"My father died in a car accident, when he was forty."
3152,801,3152,Thank you.
3153,802,3153,No.
3154,802,3154,Nope.
3155,803,3155,"Like, every day?"
3156,803,3156,"No, I don't drink at all."
3157,803,3157,"No, I don't do that at all, either."
3158,804,3158,"Ah yes, I am allergic to... what's the name of the drug? It's called Napro-"
3159,804,3159,"Yes, Naprosyn."
3160,805,3160,I am ninety three. I am a super duper old Swedish woman.
3161,805,3161,I had vomiting episodes and I am feeling very nauseous.
3162,805,3162,"I have pain in urination too, I think I might have the U T I?"
3163,805,3163,Yes that is correct.
3164,805,3164,Thank you doctor.
3165,806,3165,"No, never!"
3166,806,3166,No.
3167,806,3167,"Well, I always stayed away from drugs."
3168,806,3168,I live at my place. My kids visit me but mostly I live alone.
3169,807,3169,"Hello Doctor, I'm fifty four years old."
3170,807,3170,I identify as a female.
3171,807,3171,I have numbness and tingling in my right hand.
3172,807,3172,"I really feel it in my fifth, fourth, and third fingers."
3173,807,3173,"I've taken antiinflammatories, stayed away from sports and stuff like that, and rested."
3174,807,3174,"No, not at all, its still numb and tingling."
3175,807,3175,"I'd like to do that, what's the name of the procedure?"
3176,809,3176,I am in school.
3177,809,3177,Thanks.
3178,810,3178,"Yes, I have a wonderful baby girl at home."
3179,810,3179,"Nope, everything went very smooth. I'm thankful."
3180,810,3180,"No, thankfully."
3181,810,3181,"Correct, I never have."
3182,811,3182,I had a hip replacement years ago.
3183,811,3183,My left.
3184,811,3184,Yeah.
3185,811,3185,I also had my uterus and appendix removed. I was young when I had my appendix taken out.
3186,811,3186,Wish I did. I'd have to look back at my records and get back to you. I have everything at home.
3187,812,3187,I live with my mother around the corner where the Whole Foods is. I have been there for a few years now.
3188,813,3188,"Yes, I am taking Accutane for my acne issues."
3189,813,3189,"No, just that."
3190,814,3190,The most recent was seven years ago. I had a craniotomy. I had a brain hemorrhage and there was bleed inside and outside the brain that they had to fix.
3191,814,3191,I took a while but the doctors said I had a normal recovery time.
3192,814,3192,I had surgery on my leg for a fracture. They put some pins in my leg.
3193,814,3193,I had some kind of surgery done on my stomach when I was a kid. I am not sure what the surgery was. All I know is that it was a very common procedure with no complications.
3194,814,3194,Yep. That's it.
3195,815,3195,"Well, what exactly do you mean by that, doctor?"
3196,815,3196,"Oh, no. I don't have anything like that."
3197,816,3197,"No, I don't think so, my parents did experience some memory loss but that was when they were in their nineties. And I am assuming it was mostly from the old age rather than any neuro problem."
3198,816,3198,"Oh yeah, I have five siblings and they are pretty healthy! I mean all of them are doing good, no one has any memory issues as far as I know or any neuro related illness."
3199,817,3199,My mother has coronary artery disease.
3200,818,3200,"Sounds good to me. 
Doctor_2: Hi, ma'am. Could you confirm your age for me, please?"
3201,818,3201,"I'm seventy six years old. I'm also a resident of A S D F if that matters. 
Doctor_2: Thank you, ma'am."
3202,818,3202,That's correct.
3203,818,3203,Sounds about right.
3204,818,3204,"He did. He also did surgery on my lower legs.
Doctor_2: Thank you for confirming."
3205,818,3205,That's correct.
3206,818,3206,I feel it in the font of my lower leg and right hip.
3207,818,3207,"I told Doctor X about it. He could let you know. 
Doctor_2: She claimed she had a burning, shooting, aching, and constant pain in nature."
3208,818,3208,Yes. When I walk and stand.
3209,818,3209,I can walk around a block before it gets to the point where I get weak.
3210,818,3210,"I feel more comfortable when I'm resting, sitting, sleeping, or getting a massage."
3211,818,3211,I'd say like a nine.
3212,818,3212,"Yeah, that's correct."
3213,818,3213,I think it was a five.
3214,818,3214,"Uh. I think it starts with a T. 
Doctor_2: It states here you took Tylenol, correct?"
3215,818,3215,That's correct.
3216,819,3216,"Um, do I have to follow some special or soft diet?"
3217,819,3217,"At this age, my diet is very limited. I am going to be eighty-two next month."
3218,819,3218,"Alright, thank you."
3219,820,3219,My mother gets migraines and she told me that it runs on her side of the family.
3220,820,3220,No.
3221,821,3221,"I was, but my husband died thirty years ago."
3222,821,3222,Nope.
3223,821,3223,I did high school. I was living alone for fifteen years until December of ninety four.
3224,821,3224,My daughters have started taking care of me on a shareable basis.
3225,821,3225,Nope.
3226,822,3226,"Yeah, I quit two years ago. But before that I used to smoke two packs per day. I first started smoking as a teenager."
3227,822,3227,I used to drink six packs of beer plus two additional drinks a day for many years. Good news is that I've been dry for two years now.
3228,822,3228,No none of that.
3229,823,3229,"Yes, the last time I was seen in Pulmonary Medicine Clinic was March two thousand and four."
3230,823,3230,I have actually been hospitalized for psychiatric problems and now live in a nursing facility. Things have not been too great. I don't like living there.
3231,823,3231,"I want to live back in my apartment, but I know I am too ill to care for myself."
3232,823,3232,"I feel pretty stable. I still have shortness of breath when I do activities, but with my condition I feel like that is something I will have to live with."
3233,823,3233,The only thing that seems to have changed is that I have a small cough and produce some mucus.
3234,823,3234,"No, none of that."
3235,823,3235,"No, I luckily do not have any chest pains."
3236,824,3236,Thanks Doctor. I will be.
3237,825,3237,"Sure, I'm fifty six years old."
3238,825,3238,"Um, I'm peeing a lot, and I'm having  a little bit blood in that urine as well."
3239,825,3239,"Yes, it was unremarkable, that's what they told me."
3240,825,3240,"Um, usually during the day. I don't usually have them at night."
3241,825,3241,"No, no pain."
3242,825,3242,"No, I don't have any of that, it's just the little bit of blood."
3243,825,3243,"Um, I had Ditropan, and it didn't do very well."
3244,826,3244,"No, we're a pretty healthy family."
3245,827,3245,"I don't know, I don't know whether I am good, or my problem is getting worse and that is the reason I got myself to your clinic for a neurological consult."
3246,827,3246,Sure!
3247,827,3247,"Oh, no I referred myself to your clinic."
3248,827,3248,I am sixty four years young!
3249,827,3249,I am right handed.
3250,827,3250,"Well, lately I am having difficulty remembering names and phone numbers or even events."
3251,827,3251,"I know, but I am usually very good at remembering things. I would have not worried that much, but it was brought to my attention by my clerical staff."
3252,827,3252,"Well, I was the catholic priest at my parish, like we have our own small administrative district and church."
3253,827,3253,Around twelve months back.
3254,827,3254,"No, not at all! No social or professional faux pas whatsoever."
3255,827,3255,It's twenty eighth of February.
3256,828,3256,Thank you doctor.
3257,828,3257,Yes.
3258,829,3258,"Nope, I've never touched a cigarette nor do I plan on ever doing so. Same goes for alcohol."
3259,830,3259,Hi! Thank you.
3260,830,3260,I was diagnosed with binocular diplopia twenty five years ago but I haven't had much of an issue with it until about a year ago.
3261,830,3261,"Suddenly, I started having double vision."
3262,830,3262,It has been happening almost every day off and on through out the day.
3263,830,3263,They last for only a few minutes at a time. When I was first diagnosed years ago it happened for a year and then it stopped happening. It was not happening as often as it is now.
3264,830,3264,No. It spontaneously resolved and so I didn't need to seek any treatment. Back when all this was happening it had two episodes of a drooping eyelid. I thought I had myasthenia gravis but I was told that that was probably not the case.
3265,830,3265,I don't remember?
3266,830,3266,I am right handed.
3267,830,3267,I am sixty seven.
3268,830,3268,Yes.
3269,830,3269,Yes. That makes it worse too. When I put my hand over one eye is goes away.
3270,830,3270,No.
3271,832,3271,Thank you.
3272,832,3272,"Yes, that's correct."
3273,832,3273,Yes.
3274,832,3274,Yes. I was working as a C N A at the Veteran's House.
3275,832,3275,"I was transferring a patient from a wheal chair to a bed, and I hurt my shoulder."
3276,832,3276,"January first, two thousand and two."
3277,832,3277,No. I have not been able to go back to work yet.
3278,832,3278,"I am a thirty one year old, white, female."
3279,832,3279,No.
3280,832,3280,Right.
3281,832,3281,No.
3282,832,3282,No.
3283,832,3283,Okey. I have done a lot of different treatments.
3284,832,3284,"I tried physical therapy. They did a subacromion decompression treatment in November, two thousand and two."
3285,832,3285,Not much. I went and saw Doctor Lin and he said that I might have a nerve fiber injury. I forget what he called it.
3286,832,3286,Yes. That sounds right.
3287,832,3287,Okey. They should be in my chart. I had Doctor Lin send over all my records.
3288,832,3288,Whatever that means? I ended up getting a nerve block because I was still in pain. Doctor Lin did one in the frount of my shoulder and then another in the back.
3289,832,3289,"Yes, it has been."
3290,833,3290,I've actually never been vaccinated before. My parents don't believe in vaccines.
3291,834,3291,Hi! Thank you.
3292,834,3292,No. I don't have any health problems.
3293,834,3293,No. I don't have health insurance right now.
3294,835,3294,Yes.
3295,835,3295,No.
3296,836,3296,"In the past I was very very fat! Actually, I was morbidly obese. I also had high blood pressure, but after my surgery it got resolved."
3297,836,3297,Yeah.
3298,837,3298,Yeah.
3299,837,3299,"Yeah, I think so."
3300,838,3300,You mean like heart issues in the family?
3301,838,3301,My brother died of heart attack. It was sudden everyone was shocked.
3302,838,3302,He was not that old; he was just in his fifties.
3303,839,3303,I felt like my heart will explode. I have never felt palpitations like this. I am feeling so weak.
3304,839,3304,This afternoon.
3305,839,3305,"Yes.
Guest_family: My mom has stopped taking her medications."
3306,839,3306,"Well, I drink about four to five glasses of wine every day. I drank last night."
3307,839,3307,I am trying doctor and honestly these are all withdrawal symptoms. I have never felt like this before.
3308,840,3308,I am here for a breast cancer screening.
3309,840,3309,"Yes, I have. I also try to keep up with my self examinations every few weeks."
3310,840,3310,I try to be as careful as I can since my sister had breast cancer.
3311,841,3311,"Good morning, doctor."
3312,841,3312,"Well, I've had toe problems in the past."
3313,841,3313,"Actually, yes, I've had left knee issues in the past, too."
3314,842,3314,"Um, yeah, I had a mastectomy, and chest tube placement."
3315,842,3315,"Yeah, I have chronic A F I B."
3316,843,3316,"Well, I've been taking the Cialis, it's the, um, ten M G version."
3317,843,3317,"Yes, I've had some, which is good."
3318,843,3318,"No, none yet."
3319,843,3319,"Well, they're firm now, and I can penetrate again for about ten minutes."
3320,843,3320,"No sir, I stopped using my nitroglycerin too."
3321,843,3321,"No, nothing like that."
3322,843,3322,"No, nothing like that, sir, everything is normal."
3323,843,3323,"I go about every three hours or so, I have a good stream and everything."
3324,843,3324,"No, I sleep through the night very well."
3325,843,3325,"Well, I have a history of elevated P S A, and I had a biopsy in June when I had a, um, high grade P I N."
3326,843,3326,It was eleven point six.
3327,844,3327,"We were suspecting it all along, but now since it is confirmed it's just hard to accept."
3328,844,3328,"No, I am okay."
3329,844,3329,"Yeah, that I know."
3330,844,3330,"No, I don't have any heart condition."
3331,844,3331,No.
3332,844,3332,Hm.
3333,845,3333,Yes. I am happily living together with my husband and my four kids.
3334,845,3334,Nope.
3335,845,3335,Nope.
3336,846,3336,Oh yes.
3337,846,3337,"So, my mother's side family had heart issues. My dad's sister had sugar problem."
3338,847,3338,That's right.
3339,847,3339,Nope nothing.
3340,849,3340,"Yes, they removed lump from my left breast."
3341,849,3341,"I do not have a gall bladder, then I had a breast augmentation, I have had heart surgeries three times and they have removed half of my pancreas."
3342,849,3342,"And knee surgery too, on the left side."
3343,849,3343,Cardiac ablation.
3344,851,3344,My family has high blood pressure and diabetes.
3345,851,3345,No.
3346,851,3346,"Yes. I have a son, he was born on October thirty first, two thousand and eight."
3347,852,3347,I remember I did have something heart related but I don't know what that was. I do not understand any medical terms.
3348,852,3348,"I do have hypertension and diabetes, you know that right?"
3349,852,3349,"Yes, four years back I had lung embolism. I also get frequent urine infections."
3350,852,3350,"Yes, that's about right."
3351,852,3351,"I have had my appendix taken out, then C Section, cataract surgery and hernia repair done in the past."
3352,853,3352,"Good afternoon, doctor."
3353,853,3353,"Yes, happily to my husband."
3354,853,3354,I work as an office manager right now.
3355,853,3355,"Yes, I do. I've smoked a pack a day for the last twenty years."
3356,853,3356,"Actually, yes, I drink daily."
3357,853,3357,"Well, it varies, but usually about anywhere from three to five drinks a day."
3358,853,3358,"No, absolutely not."
3359,853,3359,"Well, I go for walks, and like low impact cardio. But, I do like playing softball with my friends too."
3360,853,3360,I work out a few times a month.
3361,854,3361,Okay.
3362,854,3362,No headaches.
3363,854,3363,No cough.
3364,854,3364,Nope.
3365,854,3365,Nope.
3366,854,3366,None.
3367,854,3367,Nope. All normal.
3368,855,3368,No changes.
3369,856,3369,"Yes, sir. In my seventy eight years on this Earth, I have learned to take my health more seriously. I need to start catching things before they come, not after."
3370,856,3370,"Yes, I had a right knee replacement. I am doing great so far. Nothing to complain about. I can do almost anything I desire now. It is such a good lifestyle change from before surgery."
3371,856,3371,I travel every chance I get. I just got back from a cruise.
3372,856,3372,"No, nothing like that."
3373,856,3373,I only get short of breath when I walk up the stairs.
3374,856,3374,I thought so. I remember being young and still struggling with stairs.
3375,856,3375,No.
3376,856,3376,Yes. Doctor Ferguson takes care of me for that.
3377,856,3377,"Yes, I go to Doctor Roszhart."
3378,856,3378,"Surprisingly, from all the walking I do, I do not have any swelling. After quitting smoking ten years ago I had to get addicted to something else and that was walking and travelling."
3379,857,3379,"Um, I don't remember correctly, but it should be in my reports. I did have one sometime back, just don't remember when exactly."
3380,857,3380,Cool.
3381,858,3381,I stay nearby in my apartment.
3382,858,3382,"No, I stay with my boyfriend."
3383,858,3383,Both.
3384,858,3384,"Well, I smoke a lot. Seven to eight packs per day."
3385,858,3385,"I don't remember exactly but for many, many years, I have a long history of chain smoking."
3386,858,3386,"Same, I drink heavily. I have been drinking for many years."
3387,859,3387,One less than sixty.
3388,859,3388,"I was visiting my son in Cheyenne, Wyoming, then I on October tenth when I was taking a shower, I felt a pop in my head. I don't know what happened after that. 
Guest_family: We thought he was having a long shower that day. Then about one and a half hours later my son suspected something is not right and we went up to check. There we found him unconscious on the shower floor. Our son, he then drove us back to Iowa and since then he is complaining of these headaches and that he's not feeling well. He gets unconscious or falls asleep I don't know but it is happening a lot of the time. We got him to local hospital today in the morning. It is three days after that shower incident."
3389,860,3389,This will be my second. I had a hernia repair back in O ten.
3390,861,3390,I work at the Hilton as a head chef.
3391,861,3391,Nope.
3392,861,3392,"No, none of that."
3393,862,3393,I'd have to say at the heels of my feet. I spend a lot of time on my feet at work.
3394,862,3394,Regular tennis shoes.
3395,862,3395,"Eh not really, but they're pretty durable."
3396,862,3396,"Alright, I'm good with that plan."
3397,862,3397,"No, just heel pain for now."
3398,863,3398,"I was taking drugs. I tried all the methods, mainly I was using inhalation and I V drugs."
3399,863,3399,Yes. I'm also going to the psychiatry department for my depression and these drug issues.
3400,863,3400,I live with my roommate.
3401,864,3401,That's okay.
3402,864,3402,Both of my parents had diabetes.
3403,865,3403,I don't know.
3404,865,3404,I don't know my father. No idea about his family.
3405,865,3405,I have no idea. I'm not in contact with her.
3406,866,3406,"Good morning, doctor. I'm forty one."
3407,866,3407,It's been about two years now.
3408,866,3408,"Yeah, I sprained my MCL while playing hockey back then."
3409,866,3409,"Well, the knee locks up on me, I can't extend it all the way, and it just hurts really bad if I try to."
3410,866,3410,"No, not at all."
3411,867,3411,"Yes, for three days now."
3412,867,3412,"Um no, not really. I've had a terrible cough along with frequent headaches and chest congestion. I have also had a low fever."
3413,867,3413,I think so.
3414,867,3414,Both sides. I'd say it's at a three currently.
3415,867,3415,"No, but it does get worse whenever I cough."
3416,867,3416,Oh no. I had something like it about ten months ago.
3417,867,3417,"It would come and go, but over the past few days it's gotten worse. I am a strong German man so I held out coming to the doctor as long as I could."
3418,868,3418,No.
3419,868,3419,No.
3420,869,3420,No.
3421,869,3421,None.
3422,870,3422,"Yeah, I need to get this loud and obnoxious snoring under control. I keep waking up my partner. I have a C P A P right now because I was told I have almost severe sleep apnea."
3423,870,3423,"It definitely has reduced my snoring, but my partner keeps waking me up in the middle of the night because the mask pops off. I wear it around five to seven nights a week, but for some reason it falls off or I take it off randomly in the night. My wife usually must remind me to put it back on."
3424,870,3424,Usually I sleep around eleven or eleven thirty and wake up at six or seven on the weekends. I'll sleep in until eight or nine on the weekdays. On Saturday's I might go to sleep around midnight because I usually watch a show with my family. I feel good when I wake up though. Much less tossing and turning. The sheets are always on the bed still.
3425,870,3425,Thanks. It has been a lot of exercising and dieting. I am motivated because I want to stop snoring.
3426,870,3426,"I still work at Smith Barney in downtown Baltimore. I work from around eight or eight thirty to five or five thirty. I deal with training on how to sell managed funds and accounts. I do not think I have been stressed because I am able to stay awake through my shift and even when I come home at night. I may get a little tired during hay fever season, but that is rare."
3427,871,3427,I have a lot of anxiety.
3428,871,3428,I have a lot of pain in my chest as well.
3429,871,3429,"Yes, I cannot stop myself. I have tried many times but it's hard to control."
3430,872,3430,No.
3431,872,3431,"I drink, but just normal. I don't have any alcohol problem."
3432,872,3432,"No, not at all."
3433,873,3433,I am here for a follow up on my heart rhythm problem. I think it is atrial fibrillation.
3434,873,3434,That's right. I misplaced it.
3435,873,3435,I am feeling very dizzy. I do have some vertigo and lightheadedness.
3436,873,3436,"No, you are right but please stop the Coumadin. I am tired of these regular blood draws."
3437,873,3437,Yes exactly. That is why I don't want it. Give me something simple.
3438,873,3438,"Oh no, I am not feeling that."
3439,873,3439,"Actually, I am moving around a little bit better now and my arm does not hurt."
3440,873,3440,"Um, it is improving as well."
3441,873,3441,Yeah.
3442,874,3442,"Good morning, doctor."
3443,874,3443,Yes sir.
3444,874,3444,I've been having pain in this knee for about a month now.
3445,874,3445,"Um, yeah, I was playing basketball when I jumped, and then when I landed I felt this knee pop."
3446,874,3446,"We went to another clinic first, and they put me in a splint. 
Guest_family: Yeah, and then they referred us over to Children's."
3447,874,3447,"Yes, I got back a few minutes ago."
3448,874,3448,"What, where? Can you show me?"
3449,875,3449,"Sure, good afternoon, doctor. I'm sixty one years old."
3450,875,3450,"I have some notes here with me, but I have a history of polyarteritis nodosa mononeuritis multiplex."
3451,875,3451,"Um, it's in my legs."
3452,875,3452,"Yeah, I was involved in an overnight sleep study on C P A P and oxygen."
3453,875,3453,It was in order to determine why I had difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep.
3454,875,3454,"Yeah, I had a review done while I was in the hospital about two weeks ago, I have the results right here."
3455,875,3455,"Um, I take pretty substantial doses of opioids in order to control it."
3456,875,3456,"Yes, I take Lasix for my leg swelling."
3457,875,3457,"I can fall asleep with it, but I usually rip my mask off because I toss and turn."
3458,875,3458,"I'd, um, say it's pretty terrible."
3459,878,3459,I smoke about three packs in a month.
3460,878,3460,No.
3461,878,3461,I am an editorial assistant at the local newspaper.
3462,879,3462,"No, thankfully."
3463,880,3463,"Yeah, yeah, I am fine."
3464,880,3464,No I am okay. I have always been healthy my whole life. Just a little fatigued now.
3465,880,3465,"Yeah, but I am okay."
3466,880,3466,"As I said, I am healthy."
3467,881,3467,I did. It was okay.
3468,881,3468,"My headaches are back. They are very severe this time. It all happened that, after that scan."
3469,881,3469,"Yes, and after that I'm having these very bad headaches."
3470,881,3470,"No, these headaches wake me up in the night. I haven't had a proper sleep in like ages."
3471,881,3471,"Everything seems like increasing it. It just gets worse with coughing, straining, sneezing, even when I'm trying to stand. I tried all the medications, but nothing is helpful. There was Imitrex and I also tried Motrin eight hundred M G twice a day, but nothing seems to be like effective. Actually, it helps a bit when I lie down."
3472,881,3472,"It is like all over but, uh, very much intense in the forehead."
3473,881,3473,No.
3474,881,3474,"Yeah, I get that ringing sound in my ears, and I just don't feel well."
3475,881,3475,"Yeah, it gets blurry, and I feel like lights are dimming. I will be meeting Doctor Y tomorrow."
3476,881,3476,"No, that's it."
3477,882,3477,"Well, I have asthma, sinus. I also have hives and there is a history of psoriasis."
3478,882,3478,Nothing that I have known.
3479,883,3479,No.
3480,884,3480,"Sorry, I'm just not feeling well. Something is wrong."
3481,884,3481,It was sometime in early May in two thousand and eight.
3482,884,3482,That's right.
3483,884,3483,"In the beginning I was thinking that it was just the stress and anxiety, but then I become worried that it might be something really different or something bad."
3484,884,3484,It started with a lot of palpitations at first. My heart was beating so fast it looks like it was ready to go out. I was having this fluttering feeling in my chest.
3485,884,3485,"Yes, very much for the last two weeks. I am worried it's my job. It is really getting to me."
3486,884,3486,Feeling very nervous an anxious actually.
3487,884,3487,"Oh yeah, whenever I'm stressed. I feel like I have more palpitations and to the level that it causes a lot of chest pain."
3488,884,3488,Nope. Haven't noticed it with the exertion part.
3489,884,3489,I had the same kind of symptoms like nine or ten years ago.
3490,884,3490,"Well, at that time a full work up was done but everything came out to be negative, so they just gave me something for my nerves. It kind of helped."
3491,884,3491,"No. It was many years ago, I don't remember."
3492,884,3492,"Yeah, for the last three days and I am having these tummy issues. I'm having on and off nausea and also, my stools are coming loose."
3493,884,3493,"Yeah, it's been some really funny green color. I don't know what's going on inside."
3494,884,3494,Nope.
3495,884,3495,"Nope, it's just some nausea."
3496,884,3496,Not as good as before.
3497,884,3497,I never did.
3498,885,3498,You got it. Nothing since last year.
3499,886,3499,I have this nasty cough and my nose has been super stuffy.
3500,886,3500,"Not really, no."
3501,886,3501,No. I did have a slight headache last night but I took Advil and it's since gotten better.
3502,886,3502,Just drinking tea and taking cough drops here and there.
3503,887,3503,"I feel pretty weak right now, but I am doing okay at the moment."
3504,887,3504,"Yes, I have. They moved me into the nursing home after I was released from the hospital. I hope that it is just temporary."
3505,887,3505,I had multiple seizures. After I was stabilized from the last seizure this side of my body in not working right.
3506,887,3506,Yes. That is why they moved me to the nursing home. I can't stand up. I am too weak. I can't take care of myself. The nurses have to help me do everything.
3507,887,3507,After being in the hospital I got an infection in my intestines. They put me on some antibiotic that I have never heard of and a probiotic.
3508,887,3508,"Yes, and then I had a radiation treatment too."
3509,887,3509,That sounds right.
3510,887,3510,What is C diff?
3511,887,3511,That make since.
3512,888,3512,"Yes, without any disturbance. I sleep like a log!"
3513,888,3513,"Nah, just the normal mood swings around my periods otherwise no problem at all."
3514,888,3514,Nope!
3515,890,3515,Help! I need help! I need to see the doctor!
3516,890,3516,My stomach! It hurts so much! I've never had this type of pain before!
3517,890,3517,At ten! I don't know. It started hurting out of nowhere. One second I'm driving home and the next thing I know I had to call-
3518,890,3518,The pain is so bad! It's hard for me to even think straight.
3519,891,3519,"Sure, go ahead."
3520,891,3520,None.
3521,891,3521,"Um no, I can see everything."
3522,891,3522,"No, nothing like that."
3523,891,3523,No I don't feel anything like that.
3524,891,3524,"No, it is fine."
3525,891,3525,No. No jaundice.
3526,891,3526,"Yeah, I mean you can say my appetite is decreased."
3527,891,3527,Oh no.
3528,891,3528,Sure.
3529,892,3529,I've had pain in this knee since I tripped on some ice on March tenth two thousand three.
3530,892,3530,I'm forty seven.
3531,892,3531,"It's hard for me to stand up without significant pain, and it feels like my knee is going to give way."
3532,892,3532,It has.
3533,892,3533,"Yes, I also feel a popping, like when I go up the stairs."
3534,892,3534,"I've had antiinflammatories and P T, but I didn't respond well at all."
3535,892,3535,"Yes, but I can't remember the name of the operation."
3536,893,3536,Uh I'm hanging in there.
3537,893,3537,Yep. My kids and grandkids threw me a surprise party. It was really nice.
3538,893,3538,"Yeah, me too. The other day, I had a lot of difficulty getting up from my chair because of weakness all over and a lightheadedness I can't seem to explain."
3539,893,3539,"Um I mean I've had falling spells several times a month for the past year, but I've always been able to get myself up one way or another."
3540,893,3540,Not that I recall. I've noticed I'm a lot weaker than before so maybe that's why I keep falling more frequently.
3541,893,3541,"No. I also forgot to mention that four hours after not being able to get up from my chair, my left hand became numb for about two hours."
3542,893,3542,Right handed.
3543,893,3543,No.
3544,894,3544,"Well, I live in this small town called Fayetteville in Tennessee."
3545,894,3545,I have few.
3546,894,3546,No.
3547,894,3547,Never did!
3548,895,3548,I am feeling better now.
3549,895,3549,I took Ecstasy. I only had two drinks.
3550,895,3550,I didn't take them all at once. I think I took six tabs.
3551,895,3551,"We started taking it kind of late. I think it was midnight. 
Guest_family: When she came home, she was agitated and physically shaking. She was pacing all over the house. Then she threw up. That is when I got nervous and called nine one one."
3552,895,3552,"No. I feel fine. Well, I feel weird but not nauseous."
3553,895,3553,No.
3554,895,3554,No.
3555,895,3555,No.
3556,895,3556,No.
3557,895,3557,"No. I was not trying to harm myself or anyone else. I just wanted to have a little fun. 
Guest_family: She seems to be back to her usual self now."
3558,895,3558,No.
3559,896,3559,"No, I am single."
3560,896,3560,Yes.
3561,896,3561,Nope I do not.
3562,897,3562,"No, my wife and I got divorced a while ago. We have three children together, though."
3563,897,3563,"Yes, I have an lawyer handling everything."
3564,897,3564,"No, I never really smoke or drink."
3565,898,3565,"No, not that I can remember."
3566,898,3566,"Nope, never had anything done."
3567,899,3567,"Sure, no problem, doctor."
3568,899,3568,"Yes, that's correct."
3569,899,3569,"Well, I have this pain in my right knee, sir."
3570,899,3570,"It's right here, on the inside of my right knee."
3571,899,3571,"Actually, yeah. I twisted it while I was at work."
3572,900,3572,"Good morning, doctor. I'm fifty nine years old."
3573,900,3573,"Um, I use my right hand for everything."
3574,900,3574,I have had this weird feeling in both of my legs for about three weeks now.
3575,900,3575,"Um, I went to the E R about a week ago."
3576,900,3576,They said I had progressive sensory and motor deficits in both legs.
3577,900,3577,"Um, I have numbness, like here starting at my trunk, and then over the last month or so, it moved into my legs."
3578,900,3578,"No, I'm numb from there down."
3579,900,3579,"Yeah, I have for the last week or so."
3580,900,3580,"Yes, it is."
3581,900,3581,"Um, about five days ago, now."
3582,900,3582,I'm having trouble walking and going up and down stairs.
3583,900,3583,"No, I'm not."
3584,900,3584,"No, thankfully not, but at the same time I haven't had a bowel movement in about three days."
3585,900,3585,It was about twenty four hours ago.
3586,900,3586,"Um, I'd say it feels cold, at least I've felt that for the last day or so."
3587,900,3587,"No, nothing there."
3588,900,3588,"Well, I've had it chronically for a while now, but I think it's getting worse."
3589,900,3589,"Um, yeah, when I try to stand up."
3590,900,3590,I've had it for about two days now.
3591,901,3591,No.
3592,902,3592,"Thank you, Doctor, I've really messed up this ankle."
3593,902,3593,"Thank you for asking, Doctor, I'm a fifty year old man."
3594,902,3594,"I fell off my liner, and I landed right onto my left foot."
3595,902,3595,"Um, it was really about ten feet."
3596,902,3596,"What does that mean, exactly?"
3597,902,3597,"Oh, that's good news."
3598,902,3598,"Yeah, the tech just brought me back."
3599,902,3599,Which bone is that?
3600,902,3600,What are we going to do about this?
3601,902,3601,"No, the ankle really took all of the weight of the fall."
3602,902,3602,Why is that?
3603,902,3603,"Okay, you're right. What are the risks of this infection with this surgery?"
3604,902,3604,Will I be asleep for this?
3605,902,3605,"Okay, yes, um, I'd like to go forward with the surgery."
3606,903,3606,"Augmentin, Detroal LA and lisinopril."
3607,904,3607,No.
3608,905,3608,I have this massive headache.
3609,905,3609,They do. Everyone has it. We've been having it for many years.
3610,905,3610,Yup. We all eat too much rice for dinner.
3611,906,3611,I've had a terrible toothache. I can't stand the pain anymore. I have never experienced this pain in fifty eight years.
3612,906,3612,It started about three weeks ago. It's mostly on the left side of my mouth. Kind of on the lower end. It goes from my jaw all the way up to my left ear.
3613,906,3613,"No, I don't think so. I'm pretty good at making my dentist appointments, although I haven't been in since this new pain started."
3614,906,3614,About two months ago for a routine clean.
3615,906,3615,"No, no swelling."
3616,906,3616,No.
3617,906,3617,"No, thank goodness."
3618,907,3618,"Well, at this point, it's been more than a few months."
3619,907,3619,"Yeah, I saw another guy a little while ago."
3620,907,3620,"Yeah, actually, they're right here."
3621,907,3621,Yes sir.
3622,907,3622,"No sir, honestly, they did nothing."
3623,907,3623,"Yes sir, the other doctor referred me over here to see if there was anything more we could do. I'd like to try surgery."
3624,908,3624,I am fifteen.
3625,908,3625,"Well, I am having a severe headache.
Guest_family: She has been complaining about it for almost six hours now."
3626,908,3626,"Um, it started from my neck and then moved up to the back of my head."
3627,908,3627,No.
3628,908,3628,"I am having nausea, but it's coming and going but no vomiting. Also, I am not able to tolerate light at all."
3629,908,3629,No.
3630,908,3630,"No.
Guest_family: No, no fever."
3631,909,3631,Yep. Right handed.
3632,909,3632,I don't do either. I can't even think of the last time I took a sip of alcohol.
3633,911,3633,No pain.
3634,912,3634,"Good afternoon, doctor."
3635,912,3635,"I'm sixty nine years old, doctor."
3636,912,3636,"Oh, I've had pain in these knees for years, but it's been getting a lot worse over the last few months."
3637,912,3637,"Absolutely, sir, yes it is."
3638,912,3638,"Another doctor called it conservative treatment, um, I've taken antiinflammatories and had some injections."
3639,912,3639,"It was, um, cortisone, and Synvisc."
3640,912,3640,"Well, it was only a temporary relief. Is there anything else we can do?"
3641,912,3641,What are the risks of infection from the surgery?
3642,912,3642,How is this possible?
3643,912,3643,"That's great, I've heard of D V T from the commercials, is there a risk for that?"
3644,912,3644,"Okay, yes, I'd like to do the surgery."
3645,914,3645,"I'm doing much better today, doctor."
3646,914,3646,They're both improving.
3647,914,3647,"No, I'm doing quite well, honestly."
3648,915,3648,Yes.
3649,915,3649,"Yes, I think that one. But I am not sure."
3650,915,3650,I mean I don't remember.
3651,916,3651,No.
3652,917,3652,"Yeah, my left eye. Never had this happen to me in my forty one years."
3653,917,3653,"Um when I was at work this morning. It felt like something was in my eye. I went to the bathroom mirror to check it out, but didn't see anything. I flushed my eyes with water in hopes of it helping with the weird feeling."
3654,917,3654,The pain has definitely gotten worse since this morning. My vision is fine and bright lights don't seem to be a problem.
3655,918,3655,I've had a lot of discomfort in my private area.
3656,918,3656,It's been going on for about two weeks now.
3657,918,3657,"Not really, no. But it's been super itchy down there."
3658,918,3658,"Uh no, but I'm having some pain here."
3659,918,3659,Yeah.
3660,918,3660,No.
3661,918,3661,"No, not yet. I thought it'd go away on it's own."
3662,918,3662,Fine with me.
3663,918,3663,"Uh once this past week, but it was pretty painful."
3664,918,3664,"Yeah, I take birth control. But I've been struggling a bit with my mood and I'm wondering if it's because of the new birth control pills."
3665,919,3665,"No, I do not have any allergies."
3666,919,3666,Nope.
3667,920,3667,Okay.
3668,921,3668,Nope.
3669,922,3669,"Oh yes, I cannot take Sulfa drugs."
3670,923,3670,I am feeling well.
3671,923,3671,"No, nothing like that."
3672,923,3672,No.
3673,923,3673,No.
3674,923,3674,"No, not at all."
3675,923,3675,Yeah.
3676,924,3676,Thank you. It is nice to meet you.
3677,924,3677,I think I may have had a stroke.
3678,924,3678,"This morning, I felt like something in my throat. It was a strange feeling. Then I felt really dizzy. My left hand and jaw felt numb."
3679,924,3679,I don't know. It is a bit confusing. I woke up this morning and I was so disoriented that I thought it was the middle of the night. My hand was numb. I also felt the numbness on the left side of my neck and my face.
3680,924,3680,Yes. I got dizzy when I tried to get out of bed.
3681,924,3681,"About three weeks ago, I had a dizzy episodes and I ended up falling down."
3682,924,3682,No.
3683,924,3683,I saw Doctor X Y Z. Doctor X Y Z put me on Antivert.
3684,924,3684,"I have not had a cold, but I did have an earache about a day or so ago."
3685,924,3685,I am seventy five years young.
3686,925,3686,My mom was healthy all her life. She died of old age. She was eighty nine years old. My dad died of a stroke. He was eighty nine as well.

3721,935,3721,I have these reports.
3722,935,3722,I have no idea. I just had these reports with me.
3723,935,3723,Huh uh.

3741,944,3741,"Good morning, Doctor. Yes, that's correct."
3742,944,3742,I hurt my knee while on the trampoline back in late August.
3743,944,3743,What do you mean?
3744,944,3744,"Oh, I twisted my knee."

3803,957,3803,Fifty two.
3804,957,3804,"Good, he has to see a heart doctor at least once a year."
3805,957,3805,Um my dad has some heart issues. He's also a type one diabetic.
3806,958,3806,I am fine. I just have a few questions about diet and exercise. I want to get my health in order.
3807,958,3807,Yes. So let's start with my mom. She died of congestive heart failure.
3808,958,3808,"Yes, unfortunately. My dad died from myocardial infarction at fifty six years old. Not sure how old my mom was."

3820,964,3820,"My O B G Y N, Doctor A."
3821,965,3821,I don't know what surgery they did today. I mean I don't know the name of it.

3823,965,3823,Sure.
3824,967,3824,"Oh doc, I've had a lot of trouble breathing lately."
3825,967,3825,"Yeah, I lose my breath so quickly with just one to two flights of stairs."

3834,969,3834,"I'm thirteen, sir."
3835,969,3835,"Yeah, I fell off the swing at school earlier this afternoon at about one thirty."
3836,969,3836,It's really bad here on my left elbow.
3837,969,3837,"I use my right hand for everything, thank goodness for that."
3838,969,3838,What does that mean?
3839,969,3839,"Yes, I do."
3840,969,3840,"No, I didn't, this is new."
3841,969,3841,"Yes, it is."
3842,970,3842,"Actually, my father passed away due to this disease."
3843,970,3843,Yeah.
3844,970,3844,"Oh, he also had this spastic colon problem and irritable bowel syndrome."
3845,970,3845,No.
3846,971,3846,I am doing okay.
3847,971,3847,I have diabetes.
3848,971,3848,"It was two thousand and three, I think. I also have high blood pressure, asthma and high cholesterol."
3849,972,3849,"Oh yeah, I don't notice anything either."
3850,972,3850,Okay.
3851,972,3851,Sure.
3852,973,3852,No.
3853,974,3853,I had a stuffy nose and it was hard to breathe.
3854,974,3854,No.
3855,974,3855,No.
3856,975,3856,No.
3857,976,3857,"Well, I got referred to P T after I had a fall."
3858,976,3858,"Um, it was on October third two thousand eight."
3859,976,3859,I tripped over my dog's toy.
3860,976,3860,"Yeah, my left foot inverted."
3861,976,3861,"Yeah, um, I've had x rays and an M R I already."
3862,976,3862,They told me that it was unremarkable.
3863,976,3863,"Well, after a month or so, the pain is still so bad I can't do any of my activities."
3864,976,3864,"Um, it's been about a month now."
3865,977,3865,"No, that never really appealed to me, doctor."
3866,977,3866,"Oh, most certainly not."
3867,977,3867,"Well, I'd say I'm an occasional drinker."
3868,978,3868,Sure. My dad had heart disease. He passed at seventy five. He had a sister with diabetes and I think my mom may have had diabetes as well.
3869,978,3869,"As for my mom, she had a long history of mini strokes. She didn't have any memory problems or dementia when she passed at eighty five. They believe she passed due to old age."
3870,979,3870,"No, not really."
3871,979,3871,"No, it's normal."
3872,979,3872,Yeah.
3873,979,3873,Both legs?
3874,979,3874,No.
3875,979,3875,Okay.
3876,980,3876,Drug allergy?
3877,981,3877,No.
3878,981,3878,Nope.
3879,981,3879,No.
3880,982,3880,Hi! Nice to meet you.
3881,982,3881,I am feeling much better today.
3882,982,3882,I am forty six.
3883,982,3883,It is much better. It is more like a dull pain now.
3884,982,3884,It has gotten better but is still a little difficult.
3885,982,3885,"Yes. I was in a car accident, years ago. The doctor told me that I had a bruised left kidney. They thought it was due to the accident, but they could not be certain."
3886,983,3886,"Well, I have a long family history of heart problems. My mom died quite young at the age of fifty due to heart attack and my father was detected with heart failure, he has a pacemaker."
3887,983,3887,"Yeah. Also, high blood pressure runs in my family."
3888,984,3888,All over my belly.
3889,984,3889,Two to three weeks.
3890,984,3890,It does.
3891,984,3891,The pain?
3892,984,3892,Hm I'd describe it as a gnawing sensation.
3893,984,3893,I believe so. I don't ever remember feeling this way before.
3894,984,3894,None.
3895,985,3895,"Hi. 
Guest_family: Hi! It is nice to meet you."
3896,985,3896,Yes.
3897,985,3897,"No, I am currently looking for someone. I have also been looking for someone to see for my mental health issues."
3898,985,3898,I would like your recommendations for both.
3899,985,3899,"No, I am not. I used to work as a registered nurse. It has become too much for me right now."
3900,985,3900,I don't do any drugs. I drink very rarely. I only drink is social situations.
3901,985,3901,"Since this last March I have been feeling more social and have been doing things on my own more. 
Guest_family: She used to never leave the house unless I go with her. She has defiantly been more independent lately. She even went and met a friend for coffee the other day."
3902,986,3902,I had a bone fragment removed from my right arm. I had a D and C done a long time ago. It was a treatment for H P V. More recently I had an ovarian cancer staging biopsy done. I have not heard back with the results yet. I only had it done less then a week ago.
3903,986,3903,I had a significant amount of pain for two to three days after. I feel better now.
3904,987,3904,No.
3905,988,3905,"I am good, thank you for asking."
3906,988,3906,"I have so many issues and problems, where do I start?"
3907,988,3907,I have this pain in my toes on the right side and I also feel this numbness there.
3908,988,3908,"Yes, I feel the tingling and sometimes. I feel like my leg has fallen asleep."
3909,988,3909,"Well, I will say it's moderate."
3910,988,3910,Maybe sharp pain but I am not sure how to describe it. But it radiates up the leg.
3911,988,3911,It's been there for almost one year but now it started to get worst.
3912,988,3912,"No, mostly when I am in bed. And sometimes I feel it on my left toe as well."
3913,988,3913,"Yeah, I thought so. I read over the internet. But anyways, I am also having this shoulder pain on both sides, plus I am not able to sleep at night."
3914,988,3914,I have high blood pressure and hypothyroidism.
3915,988,3915,"Well, that's not it. I have thrombo-"
3916,988,3916,"Yeah, that."
3917,988,3917,"I have no sinus allergies, thankfully."
3918,989,3918,No.
3919,991,3919,"I am good, Doctor."
3920,991,3920,"Yes, about one year back. I was an engineer manager back there, but my job was so stressful that when I got admitted in the M B A program here in the states, I took it."
3921,991,3921,Yeah.
3922,991,3922,I am a one women man. I married my childhood sweetheart.
3923,991,3923,"No, I haven't traveled anywhere not even within the country."
3924,991,3924,"No, I don't."
3925,991,3925,"No, never."
3926,992,3926,"No, I don't drink at all."
3927,992,3927,"Well, yes."
3928,992,3928,I smoke about a half a pack of cigarettes a day.
3929,993,3929,"Yes, I am not feeling well for the last three days.  I have bad body aches, cough and a sore throat."
3930,993,3930,It is wet and green colored stuff comes out.
3931,993,3931,Everything is fine except some chills? I am sleeping okay.
3932,993,3932,I don't need anything for the cough. I did call yesterday and got a refill of my Keflex. Then I took two Keflex this morning and I am feeling little bit better now.
3933,993,3933,I am just tired of feeling like ran down.
3934,993,3934,Hm.
3935,994,3935,"Well, I am having this weird jerky movement in my arm and leg."
3936,995,3936,"Good afternoon, doctor. Yes, this is my mom."
3937,995,3937,"Well, I used to live here in the city when I went to college, but I wanted to get away from a bad crowd, so I came back to live with my mom."
3938,995,3938,"Well, I got addicted to drugs out there, and I used to inject heroin."
3939,995,3939,"Yeah, I saw another doctor in the city."
3940,995,3940,They prescribed me methadone for a while.
3941,995,3941,"Honestly, no, it didn't help at all."
3942,995,3942,"Um, it was ten M G."
3943,995,3943,"Um, it was for three or four months."
3944,995,3944,"Yeah, um, I tried to wean off it for a while, but I was never really successful."
3945,995,3945,"Um, yeah, I've been using it occasionally."
3946,995,3946,"Yeah, so it's hard to get away from the stuff, it was all over the house. 
Guest_family: Well, he can now, especially because he lives with me."
3947,995,3947,"Um, it's been about eight days now."
3948,995,3948,"Um, it's been about a week for that now, too. Am I able to get more today?"
3949,995,3949,"Yeah, I feel down and sad a lot."
3950,995,3950,I really don't have much.
3951,995,3951,"No, nothing like that either, doctor."
3952,995,3952,"No, not that I know of. 
Guest_family: No, he hasn't been treated for anything before, doctor."
3953,995,3953,"No, everything there is complete."
3954,995,3954,"No, I don't have any."
3955,995,3955,"No, doctor. I don't take anything."
3956,995,3956,I voluntarily donated my left kidney.
3957,996,3957,"Not abuse, I just used to do drugs. The last time I really made a big mistake I injected the heroine directly into both of my thighs and unfortunately, I got these ulcers which are not going away."
3958,997,3958,No.
3959,997,3959,I don't drink.
3960,997,3960,No.
3961,997,3961,Yes. I have three kids.
3962,997,3962,No.
3963,997,3963,Yes.
3964,998,3964,They all are good.
3965,998,3965,"No, not to my knowledge."
3966,999,3966,"What, like an injury?"
3967,999,3967,"Oh, no. I've never had any problems."
3968,1000,3968,No.
3969,1001,3969,"Um, out of ten, I'd say it's about a two."
3970,1001,3970,"Um, it gets better with elevation, and when I just rest."
3971,1002,3971,Hello Doctor. I've been waiting a long time. I'm getting impatient as I get older.
3972,1002,3972,"Oh, wow. That's a nice compliment for a sixty year old lady."
3973,1002,3973,"I have these super bad headaches. Help me, please."
3974,1002,3974,I had them since I was twenty five years old.
3975,1002,3975,Not every day. That's crazy. I did get them more when my husband died in nineteen ninety six. I was heartbroken.
3976,1002,3976,It felt like a drum in my head.
3977,1002,3977,Something like that. Yes.
3978,1002,3978,Lots of it. My son wrote it on a paper so that I could give you the names. Here you go.
3979,1002,3979,They did. My headaches would vanish.
3980,1002,3980,"I think six months. My headaches stopped for a while, but they came back in two thousand and four."
3981,1002,3981,I think more than before. Like one to two per week. I also get some dizziness too. It says for two hours.
3982,1002,3982,I do. My headaches vanish after thirty minutes of taking it.
3983,1002,3983,Yes. A lot. There were zig zag lines coming out of nowhere. I thought I was going to die.
3984,1002,3984,Will you use a bright pen?
3985,1002,3985,The bright light hurts my eyes.
3986,1002,3986,Thank you.
3987,1002,3987,What light?
3988,1002,3988,That sounds scary. Will I be fine?
3989,1002,3989,"Now that you mentioned it, I am."
3990,1002,3990,I think one time. My son was there to help.
3991,1002,3991,I took some Russian medicine.
3992,1002,3992,No. I'm from Ukraine.
3993,1002,3993,It helped me a lot.
3994,1003,3994,"I used to drink before, but now I have stopped it completely."
3995,1003,3995,"It is tolerable, like five out of ten but I do need some pain medications."
3996,1003,3996,"Sometimes it gets hard, I really need some more pain medications."
3997,1003,3997,I don't like morphine. Can you change it to Dilaudid? I like that medicine. That one works for me great.
3998,1005,3998,I am married.
3999,1005,3999,Hm.
4000,1005,4000,"No, I have never."
4001,1006,4001,I am not sure. Everyone is healthy as far as I know.
4002,1007,4002,"Yes, that's all correct."
4003,1007,4003,I'm a secretary.
4004,1007,4004,"Um, I think it was on August tenth two thousand four."
4005,1007,4005,"Well, not really, and I think I have a rash too."
4006,1007,4006,"Um, at this point it's been about two months."
4007,1007,4007,"Um, it's right here, on my chest, stomach, neck, and back, it's all over my upper body."
4008,1007,4008,"Yeah, I taken five hundred M G of amoxicillin twice a day, and I use the cream as well."
4009,1007,4009,"Thank you, I've been out of medicine for about three days now though."
4010,1007,4010,"Um, my husband drove me to Healing Waters and they did, um, photofacials. Is there anything that can be done in the office today, like, um, cosmetic procedures, or do you have any skin care products? I want to keep up my appearances since I work the front office as a secretary."
4011,1008,4011,Is there anything I can take for it?
4012,1009,4012,I hurt my foot pretty bad yesterday.
4013,1009,4013,Basketball. I play for the University of Houston. I went up for a three and came down and landed on this guy's foot. I was so pissed.
4014,1009,4014,We were traveling to Duke. We could've won the game if I didn't get hurt.
4015,1009,4015,"Yeah, I did. I got taped up by the trainer, and I went back into the game."
4016,1009,4016,His name is John Houston. Do you know him?
4017,1009,4017,"Yeah, he told me to come see you. He checked my foot. Here's the notes he wrote."
4018,1009,4018,"Dang, that's whack."
4019,1009,4019,My foot twisted inwards. Kind of like this.
4020,1009,4020,"Aw, man. My foot was huge right after it happened. It hurt so much too."
4021,1009,4021,"Yeah, I am. I can't really put weight on my foot because it'll hurt a lot."
4022,1011,4022,I was working when it happened so we are going through workers comp.
4023,1011,4023,"Yeah, this arm, it was a hot oil."
4024,1011,4024,"I am using cool packs since it happened. My friend is helping me so much, he drove me to Emergency Department."
4025,1011,4025,I am forty one.
4026,1011,4026,I am a cook at coffee shop.
4027,1012,4027,"Um, I have high blood pressure, and asthma."
4028,1012,4028,"Yeah, I got diagnosed at fifteen years old."
4029,1012,4029,"Now, um, I'd say it's dormant."
4030,1014,4030,"Yeah, I take Aciphex."
4031,1014,4031,It is. I also take one baby Aspirin in the mornings.
4032,1015,4032,Yes.
4033,1015,4033,I smoke about two packs of cigarettes a day.
4034,1016,4034,No.
4035,1016,4035,No.
4036,1016,4036,Nope.
4037,1016,4037,"No, nothing like that."
4038,1017,4038,"I had my gallbladder, appendix, and uterus removed."
4039,1017,4039,"I had my gallbladder removed in O eight, appendix removed in twenty twelve, and uterus removed this past year."
4040,1017,4040,My bladder was sagging the last time I saw the urologist.
4041,1017,4041,"Yeah, I believe so. They said it was grad four last time."
4042,1017,4042,"Chip Winkel? No, not as of late."
4043,1018,4043,Yes ragweed. I am twelve.
4044,1018,4044,Yes that's right. The last ten days.
4045,1018,4045,Yes I had a little yesterday. Clear boogers.
4046,1018,4046,No.
4047,1019,4047,I'm divorced.
4048,1019,4048,"Yes, I have two boys and they live with me."
4049,1019,4049,"No, none of them."
4050,1019,4050,No.
4051,1020,4051,Yeah. She said that I um have an overactive sweat gland.
4052,1020,4052,It does.
4053,1020,4053,"Those are the red bumps, right?"
4054,1020,4054,Oh yeah. I've also had a lot of abscesses in the past.
4055,1020,4055,For about two years now.
4056,1020,4056,Correct.
4057,1021,4057,"Hello, how are you?"
4058,1021,4058,I am having this chest pain. I was hospitalized last year in October and at that time they put this catheter in my heart. I also underwent a heart scan. It's here in this report.
4059,1021,4059,Right.
4060,1021,4060,Yes.
4061,1021,4061,"Yes, in fact I have been smoking actively from pass three to four days because I am really stressed."
4062,1021,4062,"No, I did not do any exertion. Just actively smoking that's all."
4063,1022,4063,"Yes, for assault, that's why I was in detention."
4064,1022,4064,Around December of two thousand nine.
4065,1022,4065,Not sure if I am under legal contraints right now.
4066,1023,4066,"Yes, I do."
4067,1023,4067,Maybe one a day.
4068,1024,4068,"Oh man, I get a really ugly looking rash."
4069,1025,4069,"Nope, none whatsoever."
4070,1026,4070,No.
4071,1026,4071,No.
4072,1027,4072,I'm having some issues with my right hand.
4073,1027,4073,"I'm having these pins and needles kind of feeling in my hand and it has been going on for several weeks. Sometimes I feel it gets numb. I think it might be carpal tunnel, but I'm not sure. I'm just worried."
4074,1027,4074,"At work I recently moved my keyboard down. I just hope it will help. You know, I do a lot of the same kind of activities all the time. All of it I typing based."
4075,1027,4075,"It gets worse at night. If I sleep on it, like in a certain way, it will just wake me up and it starts hurting. These tingling sensations are the worst. It helps if I shake it then the sensation goes away. It irritates me all the time."
4076,1027,4076,"It is mostly my middle finger, but maybe my first or second finger of the hand also, but mostly my middle finger."
4077,1027,4077,"In my thumb as well. I'm just afraid it can be arthritis. I don't want that, too, on my plate."
4078,1028,4078,"I have been a truck driver for some time but luckily have not been in any major auto accident. I had hit a moose once, where I bumped my head but do not remember getting hurt anywhere else. I had broken my ankle in the past."
4079,1028,4079,"Oh yes, I was repairing my car and it fell off the car jack stand and fell on my chest but fortunately I was not hurt."
4080,1029,4080,"No, never."
4081,1029,4081,No.
4082,1029,4082,No.
4083,1029,4083,No.
4084,1029,4084,No.
4085,1030,4085,"No, I don't think so."
4086,1030,4086,No.
4087,1030,4087,"Oh, last year I did have some incidents of high blood pressure, but I didn't take any medications for it."
4088,1030,4088,How do you know? It's been up. About fourteen pounds since last year.
4089,1031,4089,The treatment went well. Thanks!
4090,1032,4090,In my left hand.
4091,1032,4091,No. Just that weird feeling in my left hand.
4092,1032,4092,Nothing.
4093,1032,4093,Nope.
4094,1033,4094,I've been having a lot more joint pain lately.
4095,1033,4095,Don't remind me.
4096,1033,4096,Couple years ago.
4097,1033,4097,It's caused me to become less active in general. My hands and wrists aren't as mobile.
4098,1033,4098,"No, but it's all gotten to be a little too uncomfortable."
4099,1033,4099,No.
4100,1033,4100,No.
4101,1033,4101,"I had diarrhea for a few days, but it's gotten much better. I was also having trouble holding my bladder."
4102,1033,4102,No. My incontinence is a bit better and so is my ankle and foot swelling.
4103,1033,4103,A little better.
4104,1033,4104,Not recently.
4105,1033,4105,"I'm back on Zoloft again because I think I might be depressed. Ever since losing most of my mobility, I haven't been feeling like my usual myself. I'm also sleeping all the time."
4106,1034,4106,"Yes, my sister has sinus problems. She was seen today."
4107,1034,4107,Yes.
4108,1034,4108,"No, my mom and dad are healthy."
4109,1034,4109,Hm!
4110,1035,4110,"Well, yesterday evening between seven or eight I developed nausea and suddenly it started hurting on the right side of my chest?"
4111,1035,4111,"Ah, my upper chest part and it went all around my right side till my back."
4112,1035,4112,"I feel very weak and tired, don't feel like doing anything but resting."
4113,1035,4113,"Yeah, nurse just took my temperature it was one hundred point three."
4114,1035,4114,"No, first time. I never felt like this before."
4115,1035,4115,No.
4116,1035,4116,It was yesterday.
4117,1035,4117,No.
4118,1035,4118,I am twenty eight.
4119,1035,4119,"Yes, almost one year ago. I lost about two hundred pounds after that."
4120,1035,4120,Absolutely! Until yesterday when my nausea and pain started.
4121,1036,4121,What does that mean? Why are my sodium levels so low?
4122,1036,4122,Should I start eating more salt?
4123,1036,4123,Do you think the iron will help with my tiredness? I've been so exhausted and caffeine hasn't been helping one bit.
4124,1037,4124,Yeah.
4125,1037,4125,Not as much as some people.
4126,1037,4126,"Well, I probably buy a new pack once a week."
4127,1037,4127,"Yeah, I guess so."
4128,1038,4128,"Yes, to my wonderful wife."
4129,1038,4129,"Yes, doctor, that's correct."
4130,1038,4130,"Well, I don't smoke, and I don't do anything harder, either. But I drink just about every day."
4131,1038,4131,"I drink maybe two or three drinks a day, so maybe four or nine a week."
4132,1039,4132,Let me think. You mean only blood relatives?
4133,1039,4133,Yes. We have some of those diseases in our family.
4134,1040,4134,I have had a heart bypass surgery.
4135,1040,4135,Maybe. And I have had my tonsils and appendix taken out.
4136,1041,4136,"Well, I'm not as young as I used to be, I'm fifty nine."
4137,1041,4137,"Yes, I had a fall in the beginning of two thousand six. I slipped on a freshly waxed floor."
4138,1041,4138,I fell onto my tailbone and just general lower back.
4139,1041,4139,"No, I had another one in March of two thousand six."
4140,1041,4140,"I was trying to qualify on the gun range with a handgun, when I lost my footing."
4141,1041,4141,I think it was more weakness than a loss of balance.
4142,1041,4142,"Well, I've been to P T, and I had, um, cauterization of some of the nerves in my lower back."
4143,1041,4143,"I've had it twice, once in October and the other in November."
4144,1041,4144,Correct. The P T said I have low back pain and degenerative disc disease.
4145,1042,4145,"Yeah, doctor, I've had a whole lifetime worth of back surgeries."
4146,1042,4146,I've had four.
4147,1042,4147,"Actually, I have the op notes here."
4148,1042,4148,"Yes, I had all of those with Doctor L."
4149,1042,4149,"Yes doctor, I have seven, but I had three miscarriages."
4150,1042,4150,"No, none of them were."
4151,1043,4151,I had a skin tag removed but no. No major surgeries.
4152,1044,4152,I'd say its about a six out of ten today.
4153,1044,4153,It's worse when I try to walk around on it.
4154,1044,4154,"No, thankfully I don't."
4155,1044,4155,"Oh, for a little while now."
4156,1045,4156,Sure.
4157,1045,4157,No.
4158,1045,4158,"No, nothing of that sort."
4159,1045,4159,Nope.
4160,1045,4160,"Um, no."
4161,1045,4161,"No, no allergies."
4162,1046,4162,No.
4163,1046,4163,No.
4164,1047,4164,Yes!
4165,1047,4165,"Yes, I do."
4166,1047,4166,"Well, I love my wine, I drink about four to five glasses per day."
4167,1048,4167,Yes.
4168,1049,4168,"Well, my father died of a heart attack. I don't remember how old he was, but I do remember that he had some long run heart issues."
4169,1049,4169,My mom's death was a mystery for all of us. She died of some complications because of the dental procedures. So never got to know what killed her.
4170,1049,4170,"I have a daughter, she's healthy."
4171,1050,4171,Hi. I am not doing so well. I have had this cough and a pain in my stomach. Right here by my belly button.
4172,1050,4172,Two days.  It has been very painful.
4173,1050,4173,Yes.
4174,1051,4174,"Yeah, I just finished the course for Minocin. I also took Duraphen II D M."
4175,1052,4175,"Well, yeah. Actually, my dad passed away due heart disease."
4176,1052,4176,"Yeah, it is called co-"
4177,1052,4177,"Yes, exactly!"
4178,1053,4178,"Yes, doctor, that's correct."
4179,1053,4179,"No, I haven't gotten one just yet."
4180,1053,4180,"Yeah, Project Access is trying to find me one."
4181,1053,4181,"Well, I was at Doctor X Y Z's office today, I had an appointment, but they cancelled me because I don't have the Project Access insurance yet."
4182,1053,4182,I'm having a lot of pain in my foot.
4183,1053,4183,"Yeah, I saw him on May fourteenth two thousand four."
4184,1053,4184,"Yes, that's correct."
4185,1053,4185,"Um, I got some pain medicines and muscle relaxers."
4186,1053,4186,"Well, I have this pain in my foot, and I had surgery before so there's plates and screws in it."
4187,1053,4187,"Well, I was supposed to see Doctor X Y Z about it, but since that appointment was cancelled, I came here."
4188,1053,4188,"Um, it started hurting a lot yesterday."
4189,1053,4189,"No, it's just chronically painful, honestly."
4190,1053,4190,"Yeah, I can't exercise without a lot of pain."
4191,1054,4191,No.
4192,1054,4192,You mean like meth?
4193,1054,4193,"No, never did it."
4194,1055,4194,I am doing well. Just here for a refill on my medication.
4195,1055,4195,It is going well. My husband has been on board with my meditations and yoga. He is very supportive.
4196,1055,4196,Yeah I know. I don't drink or smoke.
4197,1056,4197,Yeah. I've been taking them every day just like they told me to.
4198,1056,4198,Um I've just been taking what I have at home.
4199,1056,4199,"Okay, yeah that's fine. I can pick it up on my way home. I didn't think the dosing mattered much as long as I took the meds every day."
4200,1057,4200,"Not too many, but a catheter was put in my heart."
4201,1057,4201,Yep.
4202,1058,4202,"Yeah, that's right. Thirty four."
4203,1058,4203,"Yeah. I was rushed to the hospital that day. After, they told me to get checked for a follow up."
4204,1058,4204,One of the E R doctors and the kidney doctor.
4205,1058,4205,"Yeah, that sounds about right. Were there more details about that?"
4206,1058,4206,"Yeah, it does. I forgot why they gave it to me."
4207,1058,4207,"Oh, I see."
4208,1058,4208,I've had a lot of problems with grass and sometimes pollen.
4209,1058,4209,Nope. Never had that.
4210,1058,4210,Nope. Never had that either.
4211,1058,4211,"Yeah, I do."
4212,1058,4212,What were the treatments they gave me?
4213,1059,4213,That is not true!
4214,1059,4214,I don't want to take anymore medications. I want to try some natural remedies to treat my high blood pressure. I am not going to take any prescription meds that's it.
4215,1060,4215,"I think I got some allergy, my lips are swollen and its causing me difficulty in swallowing."
4216,1061,4216,Um I suffer from depression and high blood pressure.
4217,1061,4217,Only for high blood pressure.
4218,1061,4218,I had surgery to get a few hemorrhoids removed back in two thousand and ten.
4219,1062,4219,"No, nothing."
4220,1063,4220,"They're doing well, thank you. My three boys are all grown up. Hard to believe they're living their own as young professionals. One of them is actually a G I doctor in San Diego, California."
4221,1063,4221,My wife and I always say how lucky we are.
4222,1063,4222,Go for it.
4223,1063,4223,"I smoke about a third of a pack a day and I drink every now and again, but nothing crazy."
4224,1064,4224,"Hey, Doctor. It's been a while. I've been doing well. Just here for my check up."
4225,1064,4225,"Yeah, they're doing great. Nobody has been sick for a while."
4226,1064,4226,Not that I know of. They're all doing good.
4227,1065,4227,"Yes. It's a miracle we've lasted this long.
Guest_family: Can't argue that."
4228,1065,4228,"Yeah, he's right."
4229,1065,4229,"If I were to guess, I'd say half the time."
4230,1065,4230,No and no.
4231,1065,4231,No.
4232,1066,4232,Well‚ I am having a hard time. My whole body aches and I am in pain.
4233,1066,4233,Well yes. I am detoxing.
4234,1066,4234,Heroin.
4235,1066,4235,I don't feel well. Maybe a year. I can't sleep or eat.
4236,1066,4236,I think I have a fever. I feel chilled. I have had some diarrhea.
4237,1067,4237,"I've been in reasonably good health at least physically. I try to go on frequent walks and eat a clean diet. However, there was one instance where I was not well mentally. After my husband died in nineteen seventy five, I had what I believe was a nervous breakdown. As a result of this, I was hospitalized for several weeks and treated with E C T."
4238,1067,4238,This all happened when I was living in Korea. I'm grateful that I had my family and friends to support me.
4239,1067,4239,Absolutely.
4240,1067,4240,I used to have high blood pressure.
4241,1067,4241,Yes.
4242,1067,4242,None whatsoever.
4243,1067,4243,"No, I stay away from things like that."
4244,1068,4244,No.
4245,1068,4245,No.
4246,1068,4246,No.
4247,1068,4247,No.
4248,1068,4248,"Um, no."
4249,1068,4249,"No, nothing like that."
4250,1068,4250,"No, I did not."
4251,1068,4251,Nope.
4252,1069,4252,"Well, I just turned fifty seven this year and I would like to get rid of these wrinkles on my face. I don't like them one bit."
4253,1070,4253,"Good afternoon, doctor."
4254,1070,4254,"Oh doctor, you flatter me. I'm sixty two years old."
4255,1070,4255,"Yes, that's correct."
4256,1070,4256,I'm still having a lot of pain in this shoulder.
4257,1070,4257,"Yes, I had an M R I not too long ago, can you take a look? I have it right here."
4258,1070,4258,"Oh no, can we do another surgery to repair it again?"
4259,1070,4259,What's the risk of infection of the surgery?
4260,1070,4260,Will I be asleep again?
4261,1070,4261,"Great, yes, I'd like to go forward with the surgery. I need to get back to playing tennis."
4262,1071,4262,I dropped a glass and one of the broken pieces cut my foot pretty badly. There was a lot of blood.
4263,1071,4263,I got it to stop bleeding while I was waiting for my ride.
4264,1071,4264,"No, it doesn't hurt."
4265,1071,4265,Yes.
4266,1071,4266,No.
4267,1071,4267,No.
4268,1071,4268,No.
4269,1071,4269,No.
4270,1072,4270,"I'm actually retired, but I used to work as a dock hand."
4271,1072,4271,"Thank you so much, doctor."
4272,1072,4272,"Sure, I smoke about a half a pack of cigarettes a day."
4273,1072,4273,"Well, not anymore, but I used to be an alcoholic."
4274,1073,4274,I had my thyroids taken out.
4275,1073,4275,"Hm three years ago. Man, time flies."
4276,1073,4276,Nothing out of the ordinary.
4277,1073,4277,Doctor X.
4278,1073,4278,I had a growth on my thyroids.
4279,1073,4279,"It was. I was initially reluctant to get them out, but I realized it was necessary. I didn't have much of a choice if I wanted to live ya know."
4280,1074,4280,Hi!
4281,1075,4281,"Oh yes, I am a farmer. I have a farmland and my wife, and I do farming."
4282,1075,4282,"Ah, yes."
4283,1075,4283,Absolutely not.
4284,1075,4284,Drugs?
4285,1075,4285,"Oh that, no. No drugs."
4286,1075,4286,And I don't drink either.
4287,1076,4287,"Ah, not really!"
4288,1076,4288,"Yes, I can do all of that, no problem at all."
4289,1076,4289,Yes.
4290,1077,4290,"Well, I had colon surgery in nineteen eighty nine or was it ninety, oh yeah in nineteen ninety."
4291,1077,4291,"Ah yes, I had three surgeries for my sinus one was the same year as my colon surgery, one was before that. So, the first one was in nineteen eighty seven I believe then nineteen ninety and the last one was in two thousand five."
4292,1077,4292,"Yeah, surprisingly."
4293,1078,4293,"I'd say I have the occasional drink, but I don't smoke."
4294,1078,4294,I'm a nursing aid in a nursing home right now.
4295,1078,4295,"No, I work the second shift, so I work some late nights and early mornings."
4296,1078,4296,"No, I decided to take some time off."
4297,1078,4297,"Yeah, I'm just really tired, so I decided to step away for a little."
4298,1078,4298,"Yes, I've been dating my boyfriend for a while now."
4299,1078,4299,"No, everything is going really well."
4300,1079,4300,I haven't been feeling well since I went to the dentist.
4301,1079,4301,It was in May last year.
4302,1079,4302,"It was after I left the dentist. I was driving home, and I got lightheaded. I was so lightheaded that I had to pull over."
4303,1079,4303,About two to three minutes.
4304,1079,4304,"No. In November last year, I was in the middle of eating breakfast when I got dizzy. I was so dizzy that I was nauseous, and I threw up several times. I was so exhausted from the dizziness and throwing up that I went to my room and took a two hour nap. I felt better and back to normal after I woke up from my nap."
4305,1079,4305,"It lasted about two to three minutes. So, about the same amount of time."
4306,1079,4306,No I didn't but in January on the thirteenth my right arm went numb. It lasted for about four to five hours.
4307,1079,4307,I am right handed.
4308,1079,4308,No.
4309,1079,4309,No.
4310,1079,4310,No.
4311,1079,4311,No.
4312,1080,4312,"Yeah, you're right about that.  In my seventy six years this i have never gotten stung. This is new. 
Guest_family: He got stung around noon while I was inside preparing lunch."
4313,1080,4313,"Yeah, they got both my hands and right knee. Those little monsters."
4314,1080,4314,Um not right away.
4315,1080,4315,Bout thirty minutes or so.
4316,1080,4316,"No, surprisingly."
4317,1080,4317,No.
4318,1080,4318,I got stung about a month ago. No redness or swelling like I do now. I guess it could've been due to the Benadryl I took as soon as it happened.
4319,1080,4319,"No, I figured I'd be okay. 
Guest_family: He takes Metoprolol and Hydrochlorothiazide for his blood pressure."
4320,1080,4320,And a baby Aspirin in the mornings.
4321,1080,4321,"Yeah."""
4322,1081,4322,I was adopted.  I don't know my family medical history.
4323,1082,4323,Uh no.
4324,1082,4324,No.
4325,1084,4325,"Yes, I do."
4326,1084,4326,Okay.
4327,1085,4327,I take Tylenol.
4328,1085,4328,Yes it is.
4329,1086,4329,"Well, I was doing fine since last time. My respiratory issues have been great and I have had no major difficulties breathing."
4330,1086,4330,Yesterday I noticed that I have some back and joint pain.  When I breathe deep my back hurts.
4331,1086,4331,"No, coughing at this moment."
4332,1086,4332,"No, I already said I didn't cough."
4333,1086,4333,Nothing so far.
4334,1086,4334,I do notice that I am more tired than usual.
4335,1086,4335,No. I don't have issues with breathing when I do daily activities.
4336,1087,4336,"Hello doctor, yes, I have come a long way. I guess last time I was here was in two thousand and two if I am not wrong. Was does your system say?"
4337,1087,4337,You got it all right doctor!
4338,1087,4338,"Yes sir, still with Alaska Airlines but I have been promoted and work as a plane mechanic."
4339,1087,4339,I'm having pain in my stomach on the right side and down here.
4340,1087,4340,It is on both sides and now I can feel it on the middle part of my left thigh as well.
4341,1087,4341,"It's been going on and off. It was not there for a while, but now it is like back again mainly on my tummy, down here. It is painful when I touch it. At first, I thought maybe I'm having shingles."
4342,1087,4342,"It all started before the holidays, I think one and a half months before the holidays. It is still going on for the past eight days in my tummy and the hips mainly on the right side."
4343,1087,4343,"No, as I told you I thought it was shingles, but then there was no change in the skin, no rashes, nothing. I was not sure what to take."
4344,1087,4344,"Yes, I do but I try to use as little soap as possible."
4345,1087,4345,Yes.
4346,1088,4346,Yes.  I am in remission now.
4347,1088,4347,It has been over two years since my last treatment.
4348,1089,4348,Yeah. I smoke about a pack a day.
4349,1089,4349,Eh not really.
4350,1089,4350,Okay. I'll see what I can do.
4351,1089,4351,Socially.
4352,1089,4352,"No, but I have two littles ones."
4353,1089,4353,I have a four year old and a six year old.
4354,1089,4354,"They really do, especially the four year old. As for hobbies, I like fixing up computers. I also like fishing, hiking, and camping with the family."
4355,1090,4355,"Good morning, doctor. Sure, I'm seventy nine years old."
4356,1090,4356,"Well, I have this arthritis, as you know."
4357,1090,4357,"Well, at this point I'd say it's debilitating."
4358,1090,4358,"No, I haven't had any improvement, doctor. It's still so bad."
4359,1090,4359,"Yes, I thought so. What are the risks of infection for the surgery?"
4360,1090,4360,"That's great, what about anesthesia, will I be asleep for this?"
4361,1090,4361,"Great, yes, I'd like to do the surgery, doctor."
4362,1091,4362,Thank you.
4363,1091,4363,"I was born and raised in Iowa. My husband and I moved here twenty years ago, and we have been here ever since."
4364,1091,4364,Yes! We have two kids.
4365,1091,4365,I have a glass of wine every once and a while but no to the rest.
4366,1092,4366,"None on my father's side, but, yeah, on my mom's side some of the family members had seizures. Like, my mom had them during her childhood. I know that my great grandmother had it and so does my great aunt."
4367,1093,4367,No.
4368,1094,4368,"Sure, I have had hypertension, diabetes, asthma and cholesterol problem."
4369,1094,4369,Nope.
4370,1094,4370,Yes.
4371,1095,4371,"No, can you remind me?"
4372,1095,4372,"Um, it was about eighteen years ago now, so that was about nineteen eighty nine."
4373,1095,4373,"Sure, I have G E R D, and um, I B S."
4374,1095,4374,"Yeah, unfortunately I have those."
4375,1095,4375,"Actually, I have them in both. It's really annoying."
4376,1095,4376,"Um, another doctor called it a postnasal drip."
4377,1095,4377,"Yeah, um, I had a hernia removed and repaired some time ago."
4378,1095,4378,I've had carpal tunnel before.
4379,1095,4379,I've had it in both.
4380,1096,4380,"Yes, that's me, good morning doctor."
4381,1096,4381,"I'm forty four years young, doctor."
4382,1096,4382,I write with my right hand.
4383,1096,4383,I'm an aircraft mechanic.
4384,1096,4384,"Um, I was working on repairing an airplane at work when I fell between the plane and one of the stands."
4385,1096,4385,"Um, it was about a foot and a half."
4386,1096,4386,It was my left knee.
4387,1096,4387,"Yes I did, I had two arthroscopies, and an, um, patellar replacement after those."
4388,1096,4388,"Then, I had a left knee replacement on Month D D, Y Y Y Y."
4389,1096,4389,"I didn't have any x rays done, but I have an MRI report and notes from Doctor A B C D."
4390,1096,4390,"Yes absolutely, here."
4391,1096,4391,What does that mean?
4392,1096,4392,"Oh, thank you, that's good."
4393,1096,4393,I've done a full course of PT for this.
4394,1096,4394,"Mostly, it's here in the front of the knee, and then on both sides, like the inside and outside."
4395,1096,4395,"Yes, it goes down my, is this the femur?"
4396,1096,4396,"Then this must be my tibia, it goes down the front of that too."
4397,1096,4397,"Yes, it goes into the back of my thigh. I feel numbness and tingling back there."
4398,1096,4398,"Nope, my feet are completely normal, thankfully."
4399,1096,4399,"A little, I feel something in my lower back, I'm not sure if it's related."
4400,1096,4400,"Yeah, I can hardly walk anymore, it hurts so bad."
4401,1096,4401,"I feel popping and grinding, and my knee swells up."
4402,1096,4402,"Actually yes, it feels like pins and needles there."
4403,1096,4403,"No, nothing out of the ordinary there."
4404,1096,4404,"Um, numbness, tingling, and then that same pins and needles feeling."
4405,1096,4405,"Yes, and there's pain with it too."
4406,1096,4406,"No, I'm not right now."
4407,1096,4407,"Yes, actually, I'm allergic to a lot of pain medications."
4408,1096,4408,"Yes, I had to change my walking pattern to take weight off my knee, and I think that has to do with my back pain."
4409,1096,4409,"I'd say its constant, shooting, cramping, aching, throbbing, feels like it's being pulled, sharp, and , um, stabbing. All of those words seem fitting."
4410,1096,4410,"Yeah, it does occasionally."
4411,1096,4411,"Yeah, it gets a little better if I lay down or if I keep my leg elevated."
4412,1096,4412,"Um, I'd say six out of ten. That's how it is right now, too."
4413,1096,4413,"Easily, its ten out of ten."
4414,1096,4414,"Um, when it's not too bad, I'd say it's a three out of ten. I also have this other M R I report from September of O six, here."
4415,1097,4415,I'm eighty six years old.
4416,1097,4416,I identify as a female.
4417,1097,4417,"Its been a while, now. I know I have a fracture in my lower back."
4418,1097,4418,"Another doctor called this conservative treatment. I've been resting a lot, and using antiinflammatories."
4419,1097,4419,"Its been several months at this point, and honestly no, there's been no improvement. I'm still in a lot of pain."
4420,1097,4420,What can we do about this? I'm in so much pain.
4421,1097,4421,What's that?
4422,1097,4422,"Oh, wow, that's good to hear. What are the risks of infection?"
4423,1097,4423,How is this possible?
4424,1097,4424,"That's great, will I be under anesthesia?"
4425,1097,4425,"Great, yes, I'd like to have this done, I can't keep living in this pain."
4426,1097,4426,"Yes, thankfully, I have complete control over everything like that still."
4427,1097,4427,"Yes, I usually wear both."
4428,1097,4428,"No, I'm still very strong, even at my age."
4429,1098,4429,I'm eighteen.
4430,1098,4430,"I hurt my right knee while playing tennis, um, it was about three days ago now. It really hurts."
4431,1098,4431,"No, I took a step wrong when I went for an awkward shot."
4432,1098,4432,"Not well, it feels unstable, like I'm going to fall over."
4433,1098,4433,"Yeah, tore my ACL in two thousand eight."
4434,1098,4434,"Yeah I did, um, with Doctor X. He called it an, um, A C L reconstruction."
4435,1098,4435,"I did everything they said, I did it exactly as they wanted, and I did fine until this last injury."
4436,1098,4436,"Nope, I was really stable."
4437,1099,4437,Much better. The antibiotics seemed to really help.
4438,1099,4438,"Um no, thankfully. I had some wheezing when I first started the antibiotics, but it's improved a ton. I don't think the wheeze is even there anymore."
4439,1100,4439,"No, nothing that comes to mind."
4440,1101,4440,"Yes, a pretty bad one."
4441,1101,4441,"Well, I was running to catch a taxi and stumbled upon a piece of rock, lost my balance and fell."
4442,1101,4442,I fell face down and my head hit the sidewalk. The next thing I remember is I am all dazed and people trying to help me.
4443,1101,4443,No.
4444,1101,4444,Only the right forehead where I have the scrape and my chin.
4445,1101,4445,No.
4446,1101,4446,No.
4447,1101,4447,No.
4448,1101,4448,I am forty two.
4449,1102,4449,Okay.
4450,1102,4450,I think my family has been blessed or I don't know if any.
4451,1102,4451,Nope. No heart disease or diabetes or any other kind of issues that I'm aware of.
4452,1103,4452,Ah.
4453,1104,4453,It's been about eight or ten years now. It began while I was working in construction.
4454,1104,4454,"I'm thirty two now, so I've been in pain since I was in my twenties."
4455,1104,4455,"Yeah, um, I've actually seen several doctors before, the last I saw was Doctor A B C a few weeks ago."
4456,1104,4456,"They thought it was low back pain, and something called, um, radiculopathy."
4457,1104,4457,Yes.
4458,1104,4458,"It's been persistent, and I've had difficulties on and off since then."
4459,1104,4459,"He gave me some pain medicine, and we talked about going to another specialist for surgery."
4460,1104,4460,"Something about resurfacing the hip, or a hip replacement. I'm here for another opinion on that."
4461,1104,4461,"Yes, and I can't do any of the activities I used to."
4462,1104,4462,I've taken antibiotic steroids before.
4463,1104,4463,"Yes, a lot."
4464,1105,4464,Sure.
4465,1105,4465,"No, not really."
4466,1105,4466,Yeah.
4467,1105,4467,I understand.
4468,1106,4468,Hi.
4469,1106,4469,I feel weird. Like I feel confused. I don't know how I got here.
4470,1106,4470,No.
4471,1106,4471,Um.
4472,1106,4472,I can't think of what it is called. It's something to do with my brain.
4473,1106,4473,My doctor knows what it is.
4474,1106,4474,Doctor Frank.
4475,1106,4475,"Yes, that is his name. I don't know if that is across the street or not."
4476,1106,4476,Okay.
4477,1107,4477,"No, everything is fine."
4478,1108,4478,I know right?
4479,1109,4479,No one in my family has any health problems.
4480,1110,4480,"Oh, I am a catholic priest!"
4481,1110,4481,Yes.
4482,1110,4482,Maybe that is something for my confession box but jokes apart I don't drink.
4483,1110,4483,I understand.
4484,1110,4484,"Yes, I don't do those either."
4485,1111,4485,I live at an old age nursing home.
4486,1112,4486,"Hi Doctors, how are you?"
4487,1112,4487,"Yep.
Guest_clinician: And I see here no cardiac excretion was mentioned."
4488,1112,4488,Thank you.
4489,1113,4489,"Yes, my husband and I have lived here for a long time. He died a few years back."
4490,1113,4490,It's alright.
4491,1113,4491,"No, I don't."
4492,1113,4492,"No, I don't do anything like that."
4493,1114,4493,"Um, I take the generic for Ultracet. Sometimes I take as many as four times a day."
4494,1114,4494,"No, I'm still in pretty significant pain, doctor."
4495,1114,4495,"Yes, doctor, that's correct."
4496,1114,4496,"Well, it's been a while now."
4497,1114,4497,"Yes, into the left leg, more towards the outside of my leg."
4498,1114,4498,"Yeah, I was lifting at work on August twenty seventh two thousand three when I lifted something and felt a pretty sharp pain from my back down into my left leg."
4499,1114,4499,"No, I haven't."
4500,1114,4500,"Yes, I am."
4501,1114,4501,Okay. What are the risks of infection for this surgery?
4502,1114,4502,Will I be asleep for the surgery?
4503,1114,4503,"Okay, yes. I'd like to do the surgery."
4504,1115,4504,I'm twenty five years old.
4505,1115,4505,"Yeah, that's correct."
4506,1115,4506,That's correct. The cuts in my skins are on both legs too. Not just the right.
4507,1115,4507,"Yeah, that's correct. I had a rash that I wanted to get checked. 
Doctor_2: I remember that. I was here when she presented the rash. We suggested the rash in her lower extremities and ankles was erythema nodosum. She also had discomfort, which could have been inflammatory arthritis."
4508,1115,4508,I tried my best to.
4509,1115,4509,Could I interrupt for a second? I don't think my B twelve and iron deficiency were looked at while I stayed in the United States.
4510,1115,4510,My ankle would swell up and hurt. There were also some sensitive rashes on the skin of my legs.
4511,1115,4511,"Yeah, that's correct."
4512,1115,4512,I see. Did you find anything else?
4513,1115,4513,Yes. Thank you for going over that in front of me.
4514,1115,4514,"Yeah, that's correct. I think it's on my ankles. I also feel some joint stiffness."
4515,1115,4515,That's right. I had it twice when I was in Europe.
4516,1115,4516,"I was skiing, and my face started to swell up."
4517,1115,4517,No. My acne was stable after I stopped taking that one medicine and started the other.
4518,1115,4518,That's correct.
4519,1115,4519,I am trying to get pregnant and would like to know if the medication has any effects on pregnancy.
4520,1115,4520,"Actually, could you provide me with a pamphlet? I need to go study for my psychology classes. I have a big test tomorrow."
4521,1116,4521,Nope.
4522,1116,4522,That's right.
4523,1117,4523,"No, nothing like that Doctor! It's been well under control. I have been monitoring at home."
4524,1117,4524,No. I did not get the readings with me but I assure you I am taking care and my B P is normal.
4525,1118,4525,My dad had colon cancer.
4526,1118,4526,No. They caught it early. He passed away from old age. My mom passed away when she was in her nineties from a stroke.
4527,1118,4527,"Other then my mom having a stroke, I know of nothing else."
4528,1119,4528,I did. Here are the results.
4529,1119,4529,Not really. Is that bad?
4530,1120,4530,"Yeah, I had my gallbladder removed a few years ago."
4531,1120,4531,"Oh yeah, I forgot. I had eye surgery too."
4532,1120,4532,"Let me look at my notes, um, it looks like I had a dilation and curettage done some time back, too."
4533,1121,4533,Um. I am feeing really strange.
4534,1121,4534,I took Ecstasy over the weekend and I feel weird still. My heart is racing. I feel agitated and have been having waves of sadness. I cannot shake this feeling.
4535,1121,4535,On Saturday.
4536,1122,4536,I do. I lost my husband to prostate cancer last year.
4537,1122,4537,I'm sorry for your loss as well. It helps to remember the positive memories you had with them.
4538,1122,4538,Not bad. I've been keeping myself busy with gardening.
4539,1122,4539,"Yes, I enjoy it very much. It brings me a lot of peace."
4540,1122,4540,No.
4541,1123,4541,I feel depressed.
4542,1123,4542,"My parents were fighting for a long time, and I think they're not together anymore."
4543,1123,4543,"I usually hop houses. I'll go to my dad's house the first half of the week and spend time with his family. Then, I'll go to my mom's house during the last half of the week."
4544,1123,4544,You know what? I never thought about that. That's a really good idea.
4545,1124,4545,I'm a real estate agent.
4546,1124,4546,Almost twenty years.
4547,1124,4547,Happy to help.
4548,1124,4548,"I drink socially, but it's very infrequent."
4549,1124,4549,"Nope. Not now, not ever."
4550,1125,4550,"Thank you, doctor."
4551,1125,4551,"No, not really. Can you remind me?"
4552,1125,4552,Thank you.
4553,1125,4553,"Well, I've been under a lot of stress lately, and I had problems with my adjustments before."
4554,1125,4554,"Actually, doctor, I was in a car accident a couple weeks ago, and I'm having problems."
4555,1125,4555,I don't feel full.
4556,1125,4556,"I'm not really hungry, but I also don't feel full. When I get hungry at night I can't wait until the morning to eat. I get so hungry."
4557,1125,4557,"Yeah, I usually have a candy bar, and that helps some."
4558,1126,4558,"Ah, I now live in an assisted nursing facility."
4559,1126,4559,"No, neither."
4560,1127,4560,What do you mean by that?
4561,1127,4561,I'm not aware of any such thing in my family.
4562,1128,4562,Thank you. It's nice to meet you.
4563,1128,4563,Yes. We just got hitched last year.
4564,1128,4564,Thank you.
4565,1128,4565,"No, I don't drink."
4566,1128,4566,Yes. I know it's bad for me.
4567,1128,4567,About a pack a day.
4568,1128,4568,Okay.
4569,1129,4569,Yes.
4570,1129,4570,No.
4571,1129,4571,Okay.
4572,1129,4572,Okay.
4573,1130,4573,"I am not sure, maybe on and off."
4574,1130,4574,Okay.
4575,1130,4575,Is it different than sinus infection?
4576,1130,4576,Okay.
4577,1132,4577,I am good no problem at all other than the usual.
4578,1132,4578,"You know, some discomfort I have on my right side. I have been feeling that since I had a stroke five years back."
4579,1132,4579,Yes.
4580,1132,4580,"No, I also saw a neurologist, but nothing is helping"
4581,1132,4581,"Oh yes, Everyday at least two to three times a day."
4582,1132,4582,"Oh, that I kind of adjust myself."
4583,1132,4583,Okay.
4584,1132,4584,"No, not since I had the stroke."
4585,1132,4585,"Yeah, I am taking care of it."
4586,1133,4586,It is forty M G and I take it just once a day.
4587,1133,4587,No I do not take anything like that.
4588,1134,4588,Yes. I was also recently diagnosed with cervical dysplasia. I found out shortly after my last O B G Y N visit.
4589,1134,4589,"Yeah, the next visit is scheduled and everything."
4590,1135,4590,"Fortunately, no, not that I know of."
4591,1135,4591,"No, it doesn't ring any bells."
4592,1136,4592,I've been dealing with depression and anxiety for some time now.
4593,1136,4593,"Thank you, it is, but I manage."
4594,1136,4594,"Oh yes, I have arthritis as well. I also had sciatic pain a long time ago, and a herniated disk."
4595,1136,4595,"Actually yes, I have migraines when I'm having my period."
4596,1136,4596,"Yes, I had my appendix out."
4597,1137,4597,"I had some extreme fatigue back in nineteen ninety one. I was in therapy for six years. They had me on Prozac. I took in for that whole six years while I was in therapy. When I started the Prozac, I had just started working again. The stress at work was overwhelming."
4598,1137,4598,No. I have always had a little sadness or depressed time in my life but it had been manageable before all the work stress started happening.
4599,1137,4599,I get somewhat sad from time to time but I don't dwell on things anymore.
4600,1137,4600,No.
4601,1138,4601,"I'm in the second grade, doctor."
4602,1138,4602,"Yes, I love P E. I don't have any problems there."
4603,1139,4603,Okay.
4604,1139,4604,Yes.
4605,1139,4605,Right.
4606,1139,4606,Hm about a year and a half ago I fell while trying to walk from my bed to the living room.
4607,1139,4607,Uh yeah I did have some lightheadedness and I was a bit confused. I was aware of my surroundings though. My legs just gave out and the next thing I knew I was on the floor.
4608,1139,4608,"No, thank goodness.
Guest_family: He got up by himself and felt fine afterwards. The strangest thing."
4609,1139,4609,Yeah. I was good until my legs gave out on me July third of O eight.
4610,1139,4610,"Not this time.
Guest_family: We had to rush him to the hospital after that."
4611,1139,4611,I was later diagnosed with pneumonia. The fall was blamed on the pneumonia.
4612,1139,4612,"To be on the safe side, I started using a walker from then on."
4613,1139,4613,"Nope. I used to walk about two miles a day before all of this stuff started happening to me. This isn't even the end of it. My legs gave out on me again August O eight. No lightheadedness beforehand, but they did find that I had pneumonia again. 
Guest_family: They admitted him to the hospital and later sent him for rehab."
4614,1139,4614,Yeah. I was able to use my walker after that.
4615,1139,4615,"Uh not really, no. I had another fall in October O eight."
4616,1139,4616,Yeah. I also had shingles.
4617,1139,4617,I'm living in a Chronic Rehab Unit. I can't use my walker anymore. I'm confined to a wheelchair.
4618,1139,4618,"On top of that, I've noticed that my hands have been numb for the past three weeks."
4619,1139,4619,All.
4620,1139,4620,Yes. I feel like I've lost quite a bit of muscle in my hands. They're also much weaker than before. My strength hasn't been the same since July O eight. It's definitely getting worse.
4621,1139,4621,I've had muscle twitching in my legs since August O eight.
4622,1139,4622,Yes. In my lower legs and thighs.
4623,1139,4623,No.
4624,1139,4624,No.
4625,1139,4625,Both actually. It tends to alternate.
4626,1139,4626,No. I've noticed that my blood pressure has been out of whack. I also feel like I'm about to faint anytime I stand.
4627,1139,4627,I don't think I have much feeling in my feet. They feel like sponges.
4628,1139,4628,"Uh nine months or so. I lost joint position sense in my feet around that time, too."
4629,1140,4629,"Yeah, I've been hitting the pool five days outta the week."
4630,1140,4630,"I feel a bit stronger now compared to when I first started. I'm also way, way more energized."
4631,1141,4631,I got into a car accident a long time ago and I have always had neck pain.
4632,1141,4632,Sometimes I have back pain.
4633,1142,4633,Eh it's been a rough few days that's for sure. The pain started almost instantly.
4634,1142,4634,I actually saw a chiropractor the other day. My neck pain has been unbearable.
4635,1142,4635,Yeah.
4636,1142,4636,Nope.
4637,1142,4637,Not yet.
4638,1142,4638,Oh yeah. I'd say it's even worse than my neck pain. The pain starts in my lower back and radiates down both legs.
4639,1142,4639,"No, no pins and needles."
4640,1142,4640,The stiffness seems to worsen when I exert myself during activities.
4641,1142,4641,"Honestly, I haven't gotten much sleep since the accident. It's been so difficult to find a comfortable position to sleep in. I've never had back problems until now."
4642,1142,4642,No kidding.
4643,1142,4643,"Yeah, it's mostly during the day."
4644,1142,4644,The pain does improve a bit when I lay flat or sit up in a chair.
4645,1142,4645,"Yeah, correct."
4646,1142,4646,"A little bit, but not much."
4647,1142,4647,It's stayed more or less the same.
4648,1142,4648,Yeah.
4649,1143,4649,Okay.
4650,1144,4650,"I think I have allergies. I used to live in Seattle. I had allergies there, but I think they're getting worse after moving here. You see, I'm twenty three and I am a white female. I was in Seattle, I thought that the weather there is not for me. That's why I plan to move on here, but my allergies are not leaving me here either."
4651,1144,4651,Claritin and Zyrtec.
4652,1144,4652,"They seemed to be working for some time, but now I feel like nothing is effective anymore."
4653,1144,4653,"Yes, I tried that last summer and I've started it again like two weeks ago. But again, the story is the same. They work for some time and now it doesn't seem to be working anymore."
4654,1144,4654,I did use some over the counter ones. But I never got any prescribed nasal spray.
4655,1144,4655,I do have asthma if that counts.
4656,1144,4656,"Nope, nothing on the regular basis."
4657,1144,4657,"I don't think so. I think, I still think it is just some allergies. I want to get tested."
4658,1145,4658,Good afternoon doctor.
4659,1145,4659,"Actually, yes. I have a few. I have hyperthyroidism, and I've had gallbladder issues for some time now."
4660,1145,4660,"Oh, um, I have high blood pressure too."
4661,1146,4661,"Yes, I've been smoking about a pack, to about a pack and a half a day for more than forty years now."
4662,1146,4662,"Yeah, I drink a six pack of beer a day, doctor."
4663,1146,4663,"No, I never used anything like that."
4664,1148,4664,"Yes, I'm married to my lovely wife."
4665,1148,4665,"I was a Pepsi Cola truck driver, but thankfully, I'm retired."
4666,1148,4666,"Thank you, it's nice to be done with that. The years took their toll though, I have a lot of pain in my back and knees."
4667,1149,4667,The only thing that I know about is that my grandma has diabetes.
4668,1150,4668,I am good doctor thank you for asking. I am here to talk to you about my will.
4669,1150,4669,As you know I have terminal cancer. I have decided I do not want to be resuscitated. I have appointed my daughter as my legal healthcare proxy and she respects my wish.
4670,1150,4670,"Honestly doctor you have done enough and I am so thankful for that. I just wish to spend my last days at home surrounded with loved ones. I have my nurse, she takes care of me. I think I am fine!"
4671,1151,4671,Nope.
4672,1151,4672,Nope.
4673,1152,4673,I dislocated my wrist when I was a kid but that's all.
4674,1153,4674,No.
4675,1153,4675,No.
4676,1153,4676,No.
4677,1153,4677,"No, never."
4678,1154,4678,"Yes, my dad and brother had heart vessel blockage type of disease in their forties."
4679,1155,4679,Yeah. My left elbow is killing me.
4680,1155,4680,Seventeen.
4681,1155,4681,Yeah. My left ankle also hurts.
4682,1155,4682,Yeah.
4683,1155,4683,"Not right now, but I've had left knee pain in the past."
4684,1155,4684,I didn't pass out. I hit my head against the floor when one of the kids tried to pin me down.
4685,1155,4685,No.
4686,1155,4686,No.
4687,1155,4687,No.
4688,1156,4688,Of course.
4689,1156,4689,"Oh, yeah. A lot of my family have heart problems and cancer."
4690,1156,4690,"I'm not completely sure, but my wife may know. She's here with me right now."
4691,1156,4691,High blood pressure and food allergies run in my family too.
4692,1157,4692,"Yes sure. I got this swelling for almost three years now, and it has been worse for the past two to three months. Sometimes it gets better in the morning when I get up, but then throughout the day it begins to swell again.  Lately it is staying bigger, and it feel uncomfortable with it being so large.  The right leg also swells, but not nearly like the left leg."
4693,1157,4693,I am forty four. My biggest problem is this pain in my left shoulder. I feel as if this low back pain is due to a poor mattress.
4694,1157,4694,"No, I don't remember hurting shoulder, but gradually I am losing some mobility.  It is hard for me to get my hands behind my back or behind my head.  I am losing strength in the left shoulder gradually for the last year."
4695,1157,4695,"So far white counts are high. In April two thousand five Doctor X Y Z was asked to look at my high white count, but she thought it wasn't a problem and asked me to come for follow up."
4696,1157,4696,"I have a lot of frequency with urination, and I get up to pee at night at least two to three times.   Also, I have gained weight, I think about twelve pounds since March.  Right now, I am two eighty four pounds."
4697,1157,4697,"Yes, that's correct. It makes me pee so much. I do not take it."
4698,1157,4698,"No chest pain, but I am gradually feeling short of breath."
4699,1157,4699,"I work for the city of Wichita as bus dispatcher. My work demands sitting a lot, and just really does not move around much.  But towards the end of the day my leg swells up."
4700,1157,4700,I need cholesterol check right?
4701,1158,4701,"I am an officer at United States Marine office, artillery repair specialist."
4702,1158,4702,I use to drink socially but stopped two years back.
4703,1158,4703,No not that.
4704,1159,4704,I am good.
4705,1159,4705,I don't have any health problems. Not yet at least.
4706,1159,4706,Yes please.
4707,1160,4707,Oh okay.
4708,1161,4708,My father is alive. He is sixty nine right now. He did have some strokes in the past. My mom on the other hand died at the age of sixty two of many kinds of heart diseases.
4709,1161,4709,My maternal grandfather he also had heart issues and he died of a heart attack. Both he and my maternal grandma had some heart diseases. Their heart use to beat pretty fast.
4710,1162,4710,Hi! I have had these sores in my mouth.
4711,1162,4711,They started about ten to twelve days ago.
4712,1162,4712,"Yes, we have tried lots of different treatments and methotrexate has been working well.  I have been on it for ten years now. I have been taking about twenty or twenty five M G of per week."
4713,1162,4713,About a year ago we lowered the dosage for twenty five M G to twenty but my arthritis flared up so we went to twenty two point five.
4714,1162,4714,No. I don't think so.
4715,1162,4715,I had a sinus infection and the doctor put me on an antibiotic. That was about two weeks ago.
4716,1162,4716,"I don't remember the name of the antibiotic, but I know that I have taken antibiotics before and I didn't have a problem."
4717,1162,4717,It was three or four days long. I had to take it three times a day.
4718,1162,4718,No.
4719,1162,4719,No.
4720,1162,4720,I took Aspirin a month ago. I started taking it again because my mouth was sore.
4721,1162,4721,No.
4722,1162,4722,What a surprise! I am Cuban. A proud fifty seven year old Cuban.
4723,1163,4723,Terrible. My allergies are killing me right now.
4724,1163,4724,"Yeah, I do. I had them all the time when I lived in Seattle, but they got a lot worse when I moved here. I am a strong German woman and I hate how something as little as allergies gets the best of me."
4725,1163,4725,I wanted to experience different cities since I'm only twenty three.
4726,1163,4726,Here's a list of past and current medications I'm taking.
4727,1163,4727,"Yeah, that's correct. They were working for a bit, but then they stopped working after a while."
4728,1163,4728,"Correct. I tried out Allegra last summer, but I don't know if it was doing its job. I tried it again two weeks ago because my allergies were getting bad, but it still didn't work."
4729,1163,4729,"Yeah, I did. I wanted to see if they would work."
4730,1163,4730,Nope. I bought them at my local pharmacy.
4731,1163,4731,"Yeah, I've had it for a long time, but it hasn't gotten worse."
4732,1163,4732,No. It doesn't bother me as much as my allergies.
4733,1164,4733,I'm good. Thank you.
4734,1164,4734,Okay.
4735,1165,4735,"Yes, Doctor X referred me. My thyroid is an absolute mess. I have never been in so much pain in my seventy one years."
4736,1165,4736,I've been coughing up a storm. It's gotten to be way too enlarged.
4737,1165,4737,I signed the paperwork and everything.
4738,1165,4738,When is the earliest I can get this done again?
4739,1166,4739,"No, I am not allergic to any drugs."
4740,1166,4740,Yes.
4741,1167,4741,"Nah, just allergic to grapefruit and peanuts."
4742,1167,4742,I try to bring it with me everywhere I go.
4743,1168,4743,"Um, not that I know of."
4744,1169,4744,"No, I have a very clean history."
4745,1169,4745,No.
4746,1170,4746,"Yeah, my parents died of cancer."
4747,1170,4747,"I don't know which cancer they had, but my mother was forty two and dad was sixty two."
4748,1170,4748,"Oh, I have a big family. I have four sisters, one brother and two half brothers. One of my half brother's has asthma."
4749,1171,4749,"No, I think I am the only one who has it. Even my parents were surprised when I developed it, as no one else has it."
4750,1172,4750,Thank you. It's nice to meet you.
4751,1172,4751,I had surgery on my shoulder thirteen years ago and after the surgery I lost my sense of smell. I still can't smell. I also can't see very well in my right eye.
4752,1172,4752,I am seventy six.
4753,1172,4753,No.
4754,1172,4754,No.
4755,1172,4755,No.
4756,1172,4756,No.
4757,1173,4757,No.
4758,1174,4758,Just Tylenol for my pain.
4759,1175,4759,"Yes, I just saw her."
4760,1175,4760,"Yes, I'm not as young as I used to be."
4761,1175,4761,"I have right hand pain, and it's been there for a while now."
4762,1175,4762,"Yes, and I can't move it very well, either."
4763,1175,4763,"Well, I told you it's all in the right hand, but it's in the index and middle fingers."
4764,1175,4764,"What does that mean, doctor?"
4765,1175,4765,"Yes, they seem to lock up when I try to extend my fingers."
4766,1175,4766,"Yes, I had an E M G and it showed, um, carpal tunnel on both hands."
4767,1175,4767,"Yes, that's correct."
4768,1175,4768,I only had an injection so far.
4769,1175,4769,"Well, some, but it was really only temporary relief. Is there surgery for this?"
4770,1175,4770,What are the risks of infection from the surgery?
4771,1175,4771,"Even though it's on my hand, will I be asleep for this procedure?"
4772,1175,4772,"Okay, yes. I'd like to do the surgery."
4773,1176,4773,"Yes, I am."
4774,1176,4774,"Yes, I had a son, but unfortunately, he died in a car accident. It was five years ago."
4775,1176,4775,I work in a pharmaceutical company as a salesperson.
4776,1176,4776,"No, I've never smoked. I have tried a beer once, but I never liked it."
4777,1176,4777,"No, never did that."
4778,1177,4778,"Yes, what choice do I have?"
4779,1177,4779,"Yes, I will."
4780,1177,4780,I think so too.
4781,1178,4781,"Yeah, I had them all."
4782,1179,4782,Thank you. I am doing better.
4783,1179,4783,Um hum.
4784,1179,4784,It is going really well. She kicks my butt but it seems to be helping. Doing my exercises at home is really helping.
4785,1179,4785,"No, I wasn't. She got on me to start doing them and I have definitely seen the difference."
4786,1179,4786,"Well, the right knee is worse than the left? It mostly hurts after physical therapy."
4787,1179,4787,It feels achy.
4788,1179,4788,No. It is not all the time. Every once and a while. It feels stiff all the time.
4789,1179,4789,No.
4790,1179,4790,No.
4791,1179,4791,Several months.
4792,1179,4792,No. When I sit down or lie down at night there's no pain.
4793,1179,4793,Yeah. And it hurts when I move around. It makes it difficult to do things.
4794,1179,4794,"No, I have not noticed anything."
4795,1179,4795,Okay.
4796,1179,4796,Nope.
4797,1179,4797,No.
4798,1179,4798,"No, just the knees."
4799,1179,4799,Nope.
4800,1180,4800,"What? What? Huh?
Guest_family: She has not complained of anything like that."
4801,1180,4801,What? I can see. Of course I can see.
4802,1181,4802,Yeah.
4803,1181,4803,Oh really!
4804,1181,4804,Okay.
4805,1182,4805,"Well, I've been having some leg pain on the side of my legs."
4806,1182,4806,It's been several months at this point.
4807,1182,4807,"Um, it's the worst at night, I have to take medicine for the pain."
4808,1182,4808,"Yeah, there's no problems there. I do have some loss of feeling in my big toe and calf though."
4809,1184,4809,"Good morning, I'm sixty five years old, doctor."
4810,1184,4810,I'm doing okay. Can you remind me what operation I had?
4811,1184,4811,"Thank you, doctor."
4812,1184,4812,"Yes, I have the report right here."
4813,1184,4813,What can we do about this?
4814,1184,4814,"Oh, yeah, I remember that."
4815,1184,4815,"Oh, well that's good too."
4816,1184,4816,"Yes, I get some chest pain, but I'd say it's pretty mild. Look at my calf, doctor, it's much bigger than the right one."
4817,1184,4817,"No, there's no real tenderness."
4818,1184,4818,"Um, it's been several months at this point."
4819,1184,4819,"Yes, um, in nineteen seventy five, and in nineteen eighty five."
4820,1184,4820,"No, everything is normal there, and I'm eating normally."
4821,1184,4821,"No, that's all fine too."
4822,1184,4822,"No, all my muscles feel pretty good."
4823,1184,4823,"That's a negative, doctor."
4824,1184,4824,"No, that's normal too. I'm breathing just fine."
4825,1185,4825,"Hm, well both my father and my brother had colon cancer. My daughter was detected with breast cancer."
4826,1185,4826,"Yeah, she was forty."
4827,1185,4827,"Well, I have a heart condition and high blood pressure. I also had a stroke."
4828,1186,4828,No.
4829,1186,4829,"Nope, nothing like that."
4830,1186,4830,No.
4831,1186,4831,"Um, no."
4832,1186,4832,Nope.
4833,1186,4833,Absolutely not!
4834,1186,4834,Correct.
4835,1186,4835,Cool.
4836,1187,4836,I'm doing good. Thank you. Sugar has consistently been one hundred and thirty five or under it.
4837,1187,4837,I have a glucose monitor at home I'm using that only.
4838,1187,4838,"No, I'm fasting for my test."
4839,1187,4839,Don't worry doctor. I'm used to poking my finger all the time.
4840,1187,4840,"Yes, I'm exercising as a rule three times every week. I don't miss it."
4841,1187,4841,Nope.
4842,1187,4842,Nope.
4843,1187,4843,Not that I notice.
4844,1188,4844,Good.
4845,1188,4845,"No, she explained everything to me. I'm planning to follow-up with her in the next two weeks."
4846,1189,4846,"Oh, I stay at a care facilit. It's very near to your clinic. Have you heard about this place called South Valley Care Center?"
4847,1190,4847,I have been better!
4848,1190,4848,I have this leg pain on my left side.
4849,1190,4849,Yeah.
4850,1191,4850,"More than once. I've reacted poorly to sulfa drugs, penicillin, and some mycins. I also think I'm allergic to contrast medium."
4851,1192,4851,Yes I do smoke. Do you?
4852,1192,4852,"No, I just smoke one pack per day, it's not bad."
4853,1192,4853,Okay I will think about it.
4854,1192,4854,I work at local christmas tree farm.
4855,1193,4855,Retired some time ago.
4856,1193,4856,I used to work at a car repair shop called Champion Automotive Company.
4857,1193,4857,"I liked it a lot, but there came a time where I knew it was the end of the road for me. I'm really enjoying retirement."
4858,1193,4858,"Yeah, it can be a lot sometimes."
4859,1193,4859,I can confidently say no to each one.
4860,1195,4860,No. Nothing major.
4861,1196,4861,"Good morning, doctor."
4862,1196,4862,"Yes, I had a vasectomy some time ago."
4863,1197,4863,Sounds good.
4864,1197,4864,What does the number three stand for?
4865,1197,4865,"Okay, I see."
4866,1197,4866,"No, I think you answered them all."
4867,1198,4867,"Honestly, I'm pretty sick today. I've got a lot going on."
4868,1198,4868,"Well, it's been off and on for about a month now."
4869,1198,4869,"Yeah, it has over the last couple weeks."
4870,1198,4870,"Well, I'm coughing up this yellow phlegm. It feels like everything is in my chest."
4871,1198,4871,"I've been taking Allegra D sometimes, but I'm almost out. I need a refill."
4872,1198,4872,My foot keeps breaking out.
4873,1198,4873,"Well, it was for a while, but now it's really bad again."
4874,1198,4874,"I had, um, tinea pedis before."
4875,1198,4875,They gave me Nizoral cream.
4876,1198,4876,"Yeah, I work in the flint and it's really hot and humid down there."
